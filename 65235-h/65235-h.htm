<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> was a merry day in Torbay castle. Never had
a brighter sun shone on a fair lady than that which
now poured its mellow beams over the gay hawking
party assembled in the court yard,—while, as if
all were exhilarated by the unclouded sky above,
shouts, jests, and sallies, sly compliments and merry
laughter saluted the ear on every hand. There was
the ringing of bridles, the champing of bits, the barking
of dogs, the shouts of serving men, the orders of
the falconers, the low whispers of gay gallants, or the
half suppressed laughter of a bevy of merry young
girls, making altogether a concord of sounds, strange
and yet somewhat sweet, and not a little in unison
with the old grim walls around and the bracing character
of the morning. Foremost in the group, and
directly under the massy archway of the gate, stood
a rugged old falconer, who looked as if he might have
been an appanage of the castle from the time of the
conqueror, sustaining several <span class='it'>casts of toure</span> and <span class='it'>leses</span>
of hawks, hooded and ready for the field. To his
right was the favorite page of the mistress of the castle,
holding the white palfrey of the Lady Isabel, the
only daughter of the Earl. A few dogs lay about
awaiting the setting forth of the cavalcade. In the
rear the hawking party was assembled in what seemed
at first a promiscuous group, but it would have been
found on a closer examination, that the younger cavaliers
had each placed himself as near to his lady’s
bridle as possible, while the older sportsmen were
drawn apart by themselves, eagerly canvassing the
chances of the day’s sport.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length the cavalcade set forth, and leaving the
castle to the right, diverged towards the hills that
skirt the neighborhood of Torbay, with the object of
gaining the little river Wyse, a small stream that
runs through that delightful vicinity, and is bordered
by high overhanging banks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have said that the younger gallants each sought
his lady’s bridle rein, but it might have been noticed
as a little singular that perhaps the two handsomest
knights rode by themselves, keeping in the rear of the
“goodly companie,” and seemingly engaged in earnest
conversation. It might also have been noticed
that the Lady Isabel rode unattended, except by her
father, and that now and then, she cast a sly and perhaps
uneasy glance back at the two cavaliers. She
did this so often, that at length it attracted their attention,
and the shorter of the two companions said
to the other,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, Herbert, take heart, man—do you not
see that my fair coz is not indifferent to you—there,
as I am a knight, she is looking back again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is but to chide you for deserting her,” said the
other. “I may not be so happy as to think she cares
for me. Did you mark how chilling a reception she
gave me this morning?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Faith, man, and you deserved it,” answered his
more mercurial companion, “after your strange humor
last evening. Do your beauties and heiresses
endure all the whim of jealous suitors without resentment?
Will you never take heart of grace, leave
off this diffidence, and come boldly out and woo my
cousin in your own true and frank character? You
may depend on it she has not forgotten you since you
were playmates together, and though ten years of absence
have elapsed since then, and she has been sought
and is now sought by a score of gentlemen, yet has
she not heard of your valor continually through my
letters, and does she not blush and turn pale whenever
you come suddenly on her? What more would
you want? Tut, man, you are as blind in love as a
bat. If you had to charge a battery you would do it
without winking an eye-lid, but here you cannot attack
a fair lady’s heart without quaking like a friar,
and being in a dozen humors a day, according as your
mistress chances to smile on you or not. Take my
word for it, Isabel cares very little whether her madcap
cousin is at her bridle rein or away from it; but
she does care whether Sir Herbert Glendower is there
or not, especially just now, when her conscience is
twitching her, I dare swear, for having looked coldly
on him a half hour since, and thus driven the poor
knight almost into the notion of hanging himself.
But this jesting I see you do not like—so let us push
on and join the group, or we shall be suspected of
talking treason,” and with a gay laugh the mercurial
young man pricked his steed and pushed forward. His
companion hesitated but an instant and then followed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Herbert Glendower had known—as his fellow
soldier said—the heiress of Torbay castle in childhood;
for his own father dying, the Earl of Torbay
had filled the place of guardian to the young orphan.
At the age of fourteen, Glendower had joined the
army, but even at that early period he had imbibed
a passion for the young Isabel of which he was not
himself fully conscious, until years of watching,
strife and absence had convinced him that she was,
after all, nearer to his heart than aught beside. During
a separation of ten years from Isabel, his bosom
companion had been her reckless cousin, and perhaps
the conversation of the two young soldiers had often
turned on the young heiress and thus insensibly deepened
the passion felt for her by Glendower. Certain
it is, that when the young knight met her on his return
to England, and saw that she had grown up more
beautiful than he had imagined her even in his
dreams, he felt his passion for her increased to such
an extremity that her love became thenceforth necessary
to his very being. Yet, like too many who
love devotedly, the very depth of his passion prevented
his success, by filling him with uncalled for
doubts and fears. Usually frank and daring, he became
reserved and timorous. The slightest appearance
of coldness, although unintentional, was sufficient
to overthrow all his hope. At such times he
would throw himself on his pride, and affect a reserve
to Isabel, the consequence of which would be a coldness
on her part. Such had been the case on the
morning in question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a few minutes he mused silently, and then said
to himself:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He may be right after all; and if so, am I not a
fool? I will watch Isabel narrowly to-day, and if I
see the least glimmering of hope, I will know all.
If not, or if she refuses me”—he paused and added
sadly, “why then a foreign service and a foreign
grave will be mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meantime the hawkers had gained the river, and
while the serving men, with their dogs, descended
into the ravine to rouse the birds from the marshy
margin of the stream, the cavalcade continued its
progress along the high banks above, in momentary
expectation of the appearance of the prey. Foremost
amongst the hawkers was the father of Isabel; but
the heiress, although usually eager for the sport, appeared
to-day to partake in the pastime only as a
spectator, having surrendered her high-bred falcon
to the hands of her favorite page. Isabel herself was
silent and apparently lost in thought. And as Glendower,
in pursuance of his new determination, hovered
around her, he fancied he detected in her manner
a slight confirmation of her cousin’s assertion.
The hopes of the young knight beat high at the very
thought. He drew his steed nearer to that of Isabel,
and would have addressed her, but at that instant
the shouts of the serving men beneath, in the margin
of the river, announced that the prey had been roused,
and with a scream a huge heron, followed by one of
smaller size, rose above the bank, and stretching out
their long thin legs behind them, the quarry sailed
away up into the sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isabel,” said the Earl, “you promised to give a
cast at yonder bird—quick, unhood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, Tremaine,” said the clear silvery voice of
the maiden, assuming a sudden animation, and turning
quickly away from Glendower to her page, “throw
off my bird. You have often wished for the chance.
Now, ladies and gallants, all, we shall see rare sport
unless my falcon fails me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The happy page, blushing, however, to find all eyes
directed towards himself, trotted out a few paces in
advance of the group, and removing the hood from
the eyes of the noble bird, held the falcon on his left
wrist as he extended it over his horse’s head. The
hawk shook himself for an instant, gazed around
him until he caught sight of the herons, when he
flapped his wings, and, as the page flung him off,
darted away like an arrow in pursuit.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i005.jpg' alt='a page on horseback holding a falcon' id='iid-0002' style='width:75%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>To any other person than Glendower, the turning
of Isabel from him to her page would at such a moment,
have seemed trivial, but the proud and sensitive
nature of the lover instantly magnified it into a rebuke,
and drawing his rein around somewhat haughtily,
he gave up his original intention of keeping at
her side, and dashed madly on, leading the pursuit,
as the cavalcade galloped off in the direction where
it was expected the quarry would fall. A gallant
sight it was to see that gay party sweeping along the
banks of the stream. The caparisoned steeds, silken
scarfs, waving plumes, and proud demeanor of the
nobles, knights and pages; and the spirited palfreys,
flowing robes, and brilliant costumes of the maidens,
with the trains of attendants pressing in the rear,
gave the cavalcade a gorgeousness which later days,
in reviving this courtly sport, have in vain attempted
to imitate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, she loves me not,” said Glendower as he
galloped furiously on—“it is folly for me to pretend
to win her regard. Well—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ho, sir knight of the woful countenance,” shouted
the merry voice of Isabel’s cousin as he drew up by
Glendower, “you are leaving the route altogether,
and faith your conduct will attract notice if it has
not already done so. Come, man, in despair again—away
with it—if you won’t ride at Isabel’s bridle
and say things such as maidens love to hear, why
e’en forget her for to-day and attend to the sport—see
how her falcon mounts into the clouds; shade
your eyes—there—by St. George he has the heron
now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the knight spoke, the hawk, which had been
ascending above the heron spirally, gradually narrowing
the circles as it rose, suddenly stooped from
its height and shooting like a thunderbolt down on
the quarry bore it to the earth. The shout of the
hawkers announced that all had seen the stroke, and
instantly spur and whip were put to every steed to
reach the spot where the quarry fell, in order, if necessary,
to assist the falcon. Glendower was among
the first to lead the chase, for he felt that his conduct
was attracting attention, and he resolved during the
remainder of the day to adhere to the advice of
Isabel’s cousin, let what might take place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A wager that I reach the quarry first, and win a
smile from Isabel for assisting her falcon,” laughingly
said the mercurial soldier, “ho! Sir Glendower,
do you close with me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even so,” said Glendower; “I will distance you
a score of paces and more, or my steed belies his
former feats. Your fair cousin shall smile on me, or
rebuff me fairly, for once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the word, the two cavaliers darted forwards at
an increased pace; and instantly every eye, forgetful
of the quarry, was directed towards the race. Both
the knights rode splendid horses, and as the animals
were now pressed to show their greatest speed, their
riders seemed borne along the earth as if they were
mounted on the enchanted steeds of fairy land. The
cavaliers behind encouraged them with shouts, while
the ladies waved their scarfs and laughed gaily. For
a few minutes the horses scoured along head and
head; but, when within a few paces of where the two
birds had fallen, Glendower suddenly dashed away
from his competitor and reaching the quarry first,
threw his bridle to a youthful page who had just
arrived from the margin of the stream below, and
springing from the saddle lost not a moment in assisting
the falcon to overcome the tall and powerful bird
against which hitherto it had maintained a doubtful
fight.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i007.jpg' alt='a page kneels on the ground over a dead heron' id='iid-0003' style='width:75%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>By the time Glendower had broken the legs of the
hernsaw and stuck its long bill into the ground, as
was the duty of the first sportsman who reached the
quarry after it had been brought to the earth, the
members of the cavalcade began to arrive, and as the
knight rose from his stooping posture, with the prey
in one hand and the falcon perched on his wrist, the
silvery voice of Isabel was heard exclaiming—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! my gay coz, and so you lost your race—a
very unusual thing however for a madcap like you;
but pray what was the wager?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes!—the wager—the wager!” said a dozen
merry voices.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fair ladies, I cry your mercy; but the wager must
be a secret from you as yet, though perhaps I will
tell cousin Isabel, to raise your curiosity;” and as he
spoke, the young man bent his face to the ear of the
high-born beauty and whispered a few words, whose
import none could tell, but which brought the red
blood, like a crimson sunset, into the maiden’s cheek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But here is the winner,” continued the young
cavalier aloud, as he moved away to allow Glendower
to approach Isabel with the prey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The knight drew near, and, assuming as much
composure as he could, tendered Isabel the quarry,
in the courtly language of the day. The embarrassment
of the maiden was by no means diminished
at the address of Glendower, and, as the knight proceeded,
her demeanor appeared to infect him with a
like embarrassment, the more that every eye was directed
on the maiden and Glendower. It was, therefore,
a relief to both when a sudden shout announced
that another quarry had been started, and in an instant
one of the party cast off a falcon in pursuit.
This attracted attention from Isabel and Glendower,
and as the gay cavalcade dashed away they were left
almost alone. For a minute Glendower had not
words to speak, although something in the smile of
the maiden emboldened him to venture—indeed never
had Isabel greeted him more encouragingly. The
maiden looked on the ground and was also silent.
As usual, in such cases, the maiden was the first to
speak, and, like most of her sex, she opened the conversation
with a casual remark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yon hawk is but an <span class='it'>eyas</span>,” said she, pointing to
the bird which had just been cast off, “see, he flies
the prey. Ah! yonder goes Tremaine to lure him
down. And see, the bird is not such a foul kestrel
after all, for he answers to the call.”</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i008.jpg' alt='a page on a galloping horse waves a falcon hood in the air' id='iid-0004' style='width:75%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>As she spoke, the same page to whom we have
more than once alluded already, was seen galloping
away in the distance, waving around his head the
tasseled hood used to lure birds of the highest training,
and shouting with his voice. At the same instant
another falcon was cast off, and directly the
quarry and its pursuer were lost in the clouds, while
the cavalcade, galloped away along the banks of
the river, following the direction taken by the
heron, and leaving Isabel and Glendower wholly
alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Glendower did not for a moment reply, for a world
of thoughts was in his bosom—but over them all
reigned the consciousness that Isabel appeared to be
less repellent than she had been for days. Why then
should he not avail himself of this accidental <span class='it'>tête à
tête</span>, and learn all? Why should he be longer tortured
with doubt? He did not, therefore, directly
reply to the remark of Isabel, but his eyes followed
the form of the page for a while, and then he suddenly
turned them full on the maiden’s face. Her glance
fell beneath his own, and a blush tinged her cheeks
with a deep roseate hue. This emotion added courage
to Glendower.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isabel,” said he, speaking at first with a trembling
voice, which however became firmer and more
impassioned as he proceeded, “perhaps what I am
about to say may offend you—but I cannot restrain
the words. I love you, deeply, ardently, with my
whole soul, and whatever may be your reply, my love
will only cease with my life. Ever since we played
together in childhood I have cherished your image
in my breast—peril, absence, silence, the tumult of
war, nothing has been able to drive you from my
mind—my passion has grown with my growth, and
strengthened with my strength. Since I returned, my
love has only increased. I know how far above me
you are, and I have thought a dozen times you saw,
and would by coldness check, my presumption. But
be my punishment even banishment from your presence,
I can no longer keep silence. My love will
find words. You turn away from me—you despise
me—you sob.—Can it?—am I?—Oh! God, is this
blessing really mine?” And as the maiden, overcome
by emotion, buried her face in her hands,
her lover, at length conscious that he was beloved,
knelt on the sward at her feet, and with a sacred
feeling approaching almost to reverence—for such
was the love of those days—kissed Isabel’s white
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A month later, and there was high revelry and
feasting in the castle of Torbay; and many were the
gallant knights and ladies fair who assembled to do
honor to the nuptials of Glendower and his fair young
bride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, did I not tell you to take heart of grace?”
whispered Isabel’s mercurial cousin, unobserved in
the ear of the bridegroom, “did I not say that Isabel
had not forgotten you? By the shrine of Becket you
should thank me for my advice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What treason are you plotting?” asked the smiling
bride, approaching.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am only asking Glendower if you have paid the
wager he won from me at the hawking party—your
hand,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The imagination of the reader is powerfully
aroused by these dark inuendoes, and the mind, prepared
by a secret undefinable state of suspense and
emotion, is doubly startled by the woman’s sudden,
hushed</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>Lo you, <span class='it'>here she comes</span>!</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It is possible that, with something of the terrors
of a guilty conscience herself, the poor waiting woman
at first imagines that the queen has been listening
and caught her plotting with the doctor, for the
second exclamation shows an otherwise unaccountable
surprise at her being asleep;</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>This is her very guise, and, <span class='it'>upon my life, fast asleep</span>:
observe her: stand close.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Doctor.</span> How came she by that light?</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Gent.</span> Why it stood by her. <span class='it'>She has a light by her continually</span>:
’tis <span class='it'>her command</span>!</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Observe the short sentences—as of people listening—watching—under
the pressure of a powerful
motive and interest. The light—the doctor’s surprise
at seeing her carry it about with her, and the
reply. “<span class='it'>She has a light by her continually. ’Tis
her command.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is a new and fearful discovery of the internal
state of the wretched woman’s mind. Here we have
at once a view of her night-terrors, the guilty phantoms
which throng her bedside. It is as if a lurid
gleam had been suddenly cast upon her soul from the
half-opened gates of hell itself.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

that, even when aware of it, we can scarcely—while
looking on a countenance from which stare two wide-gazing
eyes—realize that they take no note of present
objects, but are bent only on the immaterial,
supernatural world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gentlewoman who has so often seen her thus
replies (at this moment more cool than the doctor):</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Gent.</span> Ay, but their sense is shut.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Doct.</span> What is it she does now? Look how she rubs
her hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Gent.</span> It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus

<p class='pindent'>It is not possible to call up a more harrowing type
of guilt than that furnished by this bloody queen,
thus haunted by the idea of what she has done, still
the ordinary processes of nature themselves are interrupted,
and she is driven to this species of insanity.
It is the more striking in <span class='it'>her</span>, from the contrast it
affords with her supposed callousness of character,
and the haughty, masculine, I had almost said fiendish
scorn of all those phantoms of guilt which her
more human husband saw in advance. This is the
proud and cruel mind which feared Macbeth’s <span class='it'>softer

of the deed necessary to seat them on the throne:</p>

will these hands ne’er be clean? No more o’ that,
my lord; no more o’ that;—you will mar all with this
starting.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Here another awful deed of her husband flashes
across her recollection. But still rubbing, still toiling—still
with a perseverance which shows how
frightfully she is under the dominion of horror at her
crime, she is striving and ever striving to efface its
mark, and through all with the perception that it is
in vain. Then she is at the banquet, where Macbeth’s
phrenzy conjures up the ghost of Banquo, and
half betrays them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Doctor has now seen and heard enough to show
him the nature of the secret which is destroying the
life of his patient, and his horror overflows immediately
in a sort of confidential communication with
the waiting woman.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>Go to, go to; you have known what you should not.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Gentlewoman.</span> She has spoke what she should not,
I am sure of that: Heaven knows what she has known.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Lady.</span> Here’s the smell of the blood still: all the perfumes
of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand. Oh!
oh! oh!</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Doctor.</span> What a sight is there! The heart is sorely
charg’d.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Gent.</span> I would not have such a heart in my bosom, for
the dignity of the whole body.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Here we have the moral of this grand mighty
scene. Guilt—successful guilt—guilt in the bosom,
of a scoffer—an atheist—a blasphemer—guilt in the
strongest impersonation of earthliness—of nerve—courage—self-confidence—power,
philosophy—profound
sense, and a high order of human genius. Lady
Macbeth had obviously all these. She impresses you
powerfully with a haughty superiority over every
one around her. She would do to lead an army—to
defend a citadel. Her mind is that of a Spartan dame—or
a Roman matron: and the courage and understanding
she displays are such as, if rightly used, if
guided by the spirit of virtue and religion, might have
elevated her to the dignity of a great historical heroine.
None can rationally hope to bear up by philosophy
and strength of intellect alone, against the
consciousness of sin, if Lady Macbeth, in those rude
times, could not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here, then, we have successful guilt. Painted by
a historian, perhaps she might have excited the envy
of the lowly. We should have seen her surrounded
by splendor and luxury. The glittering crown upon
her brow—a circle of courtiers bending around her—as
she presided at state councils or gay banquets.
The historian would have shown her situation, and
we might have exclaimed, “see how guilt triumphs.”
But Shakspeare gives us a view into her heart—her
secret thoughts—her midnight dreams. If any thing
could heighten the picture as he had previously drawn
it, it would be these few words, “<span class='it'>Here’s the smell of
the blood still.</span>” The <span class='it'>smell</span> of the blood! How deeply
imbued is her imagination with the ideal! The heart
sickens at it. Great as has been the crime, we are
compelled to acknowledge that the poet has at a
glimpse shown us the process of a penalty as great,
and, with a sweetness of art peculiar to him and nature,
has mingled, with our abhorrence which would
be too violent by itself, a certain touch of sympathy
and when that beautiful and heart-rending exclamation
falls with almost the last life-drops from her utterly
subdued and crushed heart—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>All the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little
hand. Oh! oh! oh!</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>We pity and utter a prayer for mercy which the
guilty lips of the sufferer dare not form themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The remark of the <a id='gent'></a>gentlewoman is as applicable to <span class='it'>a
class</span> of characters as that of Lady Macbeth.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity
of the whole body.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This is the voice of innocence—lowly, self-congratulating
innocence. The humble dependant of the royal
household is made to feel the immeasurable advantage
a peaceful conscience affords over all the passing
and hollow gauds of the world. She sees what a mockery
are rank, wealth, power, fame—when bought by
the sacrifice of that greatest of all treasures—a quiet
heart. She will go gladly, after this—that honest
lady, on her obscure path, turning to her God with a
deeper reverence and love. She will pour out her
heart to him in gratitude that she has escaped the
temptations of life thus far, and humbly implored
him to watch continually over her steps, to strengthen
her good resolutions, to teach her to subdue her passions,
and to lead her safely through the pit-falls of
her mortal pilgrimage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seems almost impossible to carry the scene farther,
but the poet does so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mind of the reader, stretched to a too strong
tension, is relieved by the few, broken yet calm expressions
of the two watchers whose health and
hearts’ ease also afford a contrast which sets off more
strikingly the state of the wretched lady thus floating
by us like a rudderless wreck sweeping onward
with a resistless current to the brink of some vast
cataract or yawning and unfathomless Maelstrom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doctor’s “Well, well, well,—” shows embarrassment
the result of amazement. He scarcely
knows what to do. He, also, has now become the
possessor of an astounding and dangerous secret, and
he might well be supposed to hesitate as to the proper
course to pursue. He does not seem decided to acknowledge
the full extent of his conviction, yet he
cannot deny that the patient is not to be cured by his
medicine. He does not seem inclined to enter upon
any confidential interchanges of opinions with the
gentlewoman. He is, in all things, the man of the
world—the professional man and the courtier. The
very air he breathes he may imagine full of eyes and
ears. He may be no more inclined to trust the gentlewoman
than she had been to trust him. Guilt,
gloom, and danger preside over the blood-stained
castle, and envelope the principal inmates—while
suspicions, fear and silent watchfulness are hugged
to the anxious bosom of each distrustful servant.
The doctor’s “Well, well, well”—is a kind of mask
to hide what is passing in his mind: and the gentlewoman
with less art, equal prudence and more piety,
ventures only upon the awe-struck prayer,</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>Pray God, it be, sir!</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The doctor then confesses,</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>This disease is beyond my practice!</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>But instantly avoids even the appearance of <span class='it'>committing</span>
himself by the cautious reserve—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>Yet I have known those which have walked in their
sleep who have died holily in their beds.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>What a picture of a tyrant’s castle. These trembling
slaves dare neither of them express an opinion
or confess they have seen what they are seeing—even
to each other in the silence and solitude of the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dream of the haunted lady now quickens its
flow. She is back again at the murder scene whose
successful completion has gratified all her worldly
hopes and ambition, and at the same time blasted her
mind and soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hear her nervous, convulsed reiteration of the
minutest incident of that too well remembered hour.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>Wash your hands, put on your night-gown;</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Then the dream shifts once more.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>I tell you yet again, Banquo’s buried; he cannot come
out of his grave.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Then back to the night of the murder.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>To bed—to bed. There’s <span class='it'>knocking at the gate</span>. Come,
come, come, come. Give me your hand, what’s done cannot
be undone. To bed, to bed, to bed.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'><span class='it'>Exit Lady Macbeth.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And thus, as from the new commission of a frightful
crime, she returns to her bed, there to tremble—and
writhe and dream—and act over again and again
the bloody drama.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Doctor.</span> Will she now go to bed?</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Gent.</span> Directly.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Then the doctor, apparently excited out of his
usual reserve, utters the thoughts which are passing
in his mind.</p>

a worldly man in the mere exercise of his profession,
is very expressive of the effect the scene has had
upon him. He immediately returns, however, to the

self-destruction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Notwithstanding these injunctions, however, she
succeeds in committing suicide. After her exit from
this scene she appears no more. She could not, indeed,
again come before our eyes without injuring
the impression it has left. Her death is told in a way
to harmonize with this impression and to leave the
excited imagination at leisure to fill up the details to
the last moment. Macbeth, desperate like a baited

scene is heightened by the contrast it affords to
her proud overbearing demeanor in the earlier scenes

were no God to supervise human affairs. When
Macbeth, his dripping hands at length burthened with
a now irreparable murder, finds himself appalled and
feels that, among the other disadvantages of the
crime, he has “murdered sleep,” “Macbeth shall
sleep no more,” “The innocent sleep,” etc., etc., his
lady is scarcely able to find words for her cool contempt
of such weakness.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE CONCLUSION.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> cool breath of morning was blowing through
the open casement, when I awoke on the ensuing
day, and as the wind dallied with the curtains of my
bed and kissed my fevered brow, I felt an exhiliration
of spirits which no one can fully appreciate
who has not experienced the torture of a bed of sickness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My dreams had been pleasant during my repose,
for they were of Beatrice. Overcome by exhaustion,
I had sank into a slumber almost immediately after
my faint attempt to address her; but I knew not how
long I slept; for, although it was now early morning,
I had no means of telling at what hour I had awoke
the day before. No one appeared to be stirring in
the room. The mild light of an October sun lay in
rich masses on the carpet, while occasionally the
brown vine leaves outside the casement, would rustle
pleasantly in the breeze. How I gazed on the patch
of blue sky discernible through that open window—how
I longed to be wandering free and uncontrolled
over the rich plains and up the glowing hill-sides that
stretched away before the vision. Oh! there is nothing
so glorious to the sick man as a sunny morning.
At this instant a bird whistled outside the casement.
How my blood danced at the lightsome tone! A succession
of dreamy, delicious feelings floated through
my soul, and I lay for some moments motionless,
but dissolved in gratitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I raised myself feebly up, and faintly pushing aside
the curtain, strove to obtain a survey of my apartment.
At length my thoughts reverted to my situation.
When I lost my consciousness, I was on a
deserted deck—now I was lying in a spacious apartment,
in perfect security. Who could explain this
mystery? It was a rich, even luxurious room. The
furniture was of the costliest and most tasteful pattern,
and the arrangement of the different articles
was made with an artist’s eye to the keeping—if I
may so speak—of the whole. A stand just in front
of me held a bouquet of fresh flowers, which, from
their rarity, must have come from some green house.
On the opposite wall hung a glorious picture of the
Madonna, with her golden hair and beatified countenance,
gazing down, with that smile which Raphael
has made immortal, on the infant on her knee. A
dim recollection floated through my brain that I had
seen that smile before, only the features which then
accompanied it, had been like those of Beatrice,
rather than of the picture. Suddenly that angel face
I had seen in my dream, flashed on me. I knew it
all now. It had been, while gazing on this divine
portrait in my delirium, that my fancy had imagined
it the face of Beatrice, smiling down upon me from
the clouds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was evident that Beatrice had some connexion
with my present situation, for I was convinced that I
had seen her the preceding day. Where was she
now?—How long had I been sick in this place?—And
in what manner was she I loved involved in
my rescue, were questions that continually forced
themselves on my mind, until my still weak brain
began to be dizzy with the mystery. Putting my
hands to my brow I strove to drive away such
thoughts; but they only returned with ten-fold force.
I would have risen to solve the mystery, but my
strength proved inefficient to the task, and I sank
back on my pillow. A half hour must thus have
passed, when I heard a light footstep on the carpet,
and in an instant my heart was throbbing, and the
blood dancing in my veins. In a moment I should
see Beatrice again. I gazed in the direction whence
the sound of the steps proceeded, and the name of
her I adored was already trembling on my lips,
when a hand gathered back the curtain, and I saw,
not Beatrice, but an elderly French woman, whose
dress bespoke her a nurse. Never did a way-worn
pilgrim, fancying he beheld the minaret of the holy
city in the distance, gaze on a <span class='it'>mirage</span> with more disappointment
than I did on the countenance of my visitor.
But my curiosity soon triumphed over my disappointment.
Perhaps she read my thoughts, for a
smile of equivocal meaning gradually stole into the
corners of her month as she returned my gaze. She
was the first to speak:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is Monsieur better?” she inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I replied, “I am almost well—sufficiently
so, at least, to feel curiosity. In a word, how and
when did I come here? Who am I to thank as my
preserver?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur has more questions to ask than even a
Parisian <span class='it'>grisette</span> could answer,” she replied, evasively.
“Besides, his physician says he must be kept
quiet. I can only tell him for the present that he is
in France. Let him be patient and he shall soon
know all. He is at any rate among friends, and when
he gets stronger he shall hear his story from other
lips than mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As this was accompanied with a meaning smile that
left no doubt on my mind to whom she alluded, and
as she seconded her words by drawing the curtains
together as if to retire, I was fain to be content.
In addition to this moreover, I felt that I had already
exerted myself sufficiently in conversation, for my
brain was dizzy with the few words I had spoken.
So I closed my eyes, and, like one wearied out with
toil, in a few minutes was asleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Several days elapsed, during which I saw no one
but the nurse, and now and then a servant or two in a
rich livery, who brought in the tray. To all my inquiries
I received the same answer, until at length,
unbounded as was my curiosity, I gave over the
attempt, comforting myself with the conviction that,
in a day or two more, I should hear my story from
the loved lips of Beatrice herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length I was able to sit up, and when the formal
old physician appeared, he announced to me with a
meaning smile, that he would now permit me to receive
visitors. He added that my host and hostess
were anxious to pay their compliments in person, and
had only been prevented hitherto from doing so by
my extreme weakness, and his express commands.
All this had an air of mystery about it which, however,
I had not time to unravel, for the physician had
scarcely ceased speaking when the door opened and
my entertainers entered, announced by a servant in a
rich livery. I started and crimsoned to the brow,
but a hasty glance assured me that Beatrice was not
there. The wonder increased,—but the physician
left me no time for thought, for, advancing on the
instant, he introduced my visitors to me formally as
a Baron and Baroness de St. Allaire. They were both
somewhat in years, at least past their prime, but their
manners, apart from their former kindness to me,
would have attracted me to them at once. The Baron
was a stately Frenchman, of the school of <span class='it'>le grand
monarque</span>, very formal, very dignified, but withal
kind hearted. His lady possessed one of the most
benignant countenances I ever recollect to have seen.
Her smile was peculiarly sweet. Her years sat on
her lightly, and with all the propriety of her age she
had all the liveliness of youth. It was not long,
therefore, before I was perfectly at ease. The Baron
expressed his satisfaction at my rapid improvement
for the better, complimented himself on his good
fortune in being my host, hoped that I found the prospect
from my window pleasant, and all this, too, with
a formality, yet an affability that realized my idea of
the old French chevalier. His lady was less precise,
and consequently more winning. She conversed even
gaily, and on a variety of subjects, all, however, having
a bearing on my illness. Yet, with a tact which
I could not but admire, she avoided every allusion to
the means by which I had become her guest, reminding
me of a skilful advocate in a bad cause, always
hovering about but never approaching the issue. A
quarter of an hour was thus spent and I had determined
to relieve my eager curiosity by broaching the
subject myself at the first pause in the conversation,
but, as if anticipating my design, the Baroness suddenly
rose, and still continuing her gay remarks,
fairly complimented herself out of the room before
I had a chance to speak without violating all etiquette
by interrupting the good lady. I fancied, as she
closed the door with an “adieu, Monsieur,” that
there was malice in her provoking smile, betokening
a lurking consciousness that she had outwitted me.
At first I was half disposed to feel angry, it was so
evident that my curiosity was trifled with. My patience
nearly gave way at these continued disappointments.
Yet I had nothing at which I could rationally
get displeased. It was in vain for me to feel angry—my
discomfiture had been too adroitly managed—and
at length I fairly burst into a laugh at my own
expense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are pleased to be merry,” said a silvery
voice behind me, and a low glad laugh that rung
through the chamber like fairy music, echoed my
own. I started up at once. I knew I could not be
mistaken. The next moment Beatrice was in my
arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rapture of that re-union I shall not attempt to
portray. If my readers have been young, and after
having been separated for years from the one they
loved, have met her as their preserver, they can appreciate
my feelings. I draw a veil over the sacred
emotions of that interview. Nor will I repeat the
thousand questions which were asked and answered
almost in the same breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was some ten minutes before Beatrice narrated
the circumstances which had transpired since I parted
with her in Charleston. Nor did she, even when she
began, give me a connected account. There were
too many questions to be asked, and too many inquiries
to be answered, all growing, it is true, out of her
story, but all sadly at variance with the course of
the narration, to permit a continuous tale. At length,
however, I learned all, or nearly all, for there were
a few things which the dear girl did not tell me until
long after,—and even then not without a blush at her
avowal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My first inquiry was about her own fortunes, but
she would not answer me until I had told her how I
came on the wreck, and she had acquainted me with
the manner of my rescue. I will give it in her own
words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When you lost your consciousness you were, I
fancy, nearer to aid than you imagine, for a French
privateer that was hovering along the coast discovered
the wreck, and making for it rescued you,
almost exhausted it is true, but still retaining life.
You were insensible, and well nigh frozen to death.
But the exertions of your preservers finally restored
you to life, though not to consciousness. You fell
into a raging fever in which you raved in a constant
delirium. The captain of the privateer, having occasion
to put into port the following day, brought you
on shore, and suspecting you to be an Englishman
from your language, unfeelingly consigned you to the
common jail hospital, among the poorest and most
degraded of human beings. There you lay the whole
of the ensuing night, scarcely tended even by the
callous nurses of those establishments. No one knew
your name; your dress was not a uniform; and death
was rapidly approaching to consign you to an unknown
grave. But Providence did not will that such
should be your fate. An all-seeing eye beheld you;
an omnipotent arm interposed to save you. And the
means of your preservation were so fortuitous as to
seem almost those of chance. The confessor of the
Baroness was in the habit of visiting the prison—for
we reside but a short drive from the town—and
while giving consolation to one of those miserable
wretches—oh! I shudder to think that you were
once there—he heard a sick man in a neighboring
ward raving of a name,” and here the dear girl
covered her face in confusion, “which was familiar
to him. Need I say it was mine? He listened, and
heard enough to satisfy him that you were acquainted
with me. He made inquiries, learned how you came
there—and you can imagine the rest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That I was brought here and saved from death,”
said I, looking fondly into Beatrice’s face. “But
you have not told me how you came here, or what
tie exists between you and our hostess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! she is my cousin. I spent some years here
in early childhood. But to tell my story I must go
back to when we last parted in Charleston.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well. I listen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know,” sweetly began Beatrice, “how much
I feared, when you were in Charleston, that my uncle
would make himself obnoxious to the colonial authorities,
and endanger perhaps his life. You knew
also, that he seemed resolved to bring about a union
betwixt his son and myself. The necessity of obtaining
my uncle’s sanction to my marriage under the
penalty of forfeiting my fortune, weighed but lightly
with me, for I knew his hostility to you to be unjust.
Yet, as the representative of my deceased parent, I
wished, if possible, to win Mr. Rochester’s sanction.
His persevering determination to unite me to his son
prevented all hope of this; and it was not long after
our parting that I saw he would never consent to my
becoming the bride of any one but his heir. Besides,
he grew every day more openly hostile to the colonies.
Unjust as I felt he was to me, I yet loved him
as my mother’s brother, and I trembled for his life.
But death suddenly interposed and calmed my fears,
only however to awaken my grief. In the grave I
buried my wrongs. I saw in him then only my
protector in a strange land—my nearest living relative—the
one with whom my sainted mother had
spent her childhood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My uncle’s decease at once changed my fortunes.
The only impediment to my enjoyment of my father’s
estate was now removed, and I was free to bestow
my hand on whomsoever I wished. My cousin renewed
his offer, at a decent interval after his father’s
death, but, need I say, I courteously yet firmly refused
it. My longer stay in Charleston was now a
matter of delicacy, for I had no relatives there except
the family of Mr. Rochester, and they naturally
viewed my decision with feelings more favorable to
my cousin than to myself. Under these circumstances
I availed myself of an opportunity that just
then presented to sail for this country, where my relative
the Baroness, with whom I had spent some
years in childhood, resided. She had continued in
correspondence with me ever since, and had urged
me in every letter to visit her, even if I could not
come and make my home with her. Little did I
think that I should meet you under the circumstances
in which I did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have little more to add. Of the letters which I
had written to Beatrice some miscarried, some were
lost in captured ships, and a few reached her months
after they had been penned. Her answers came with
even more irregularity, for since the day we had
parted in Charleston I had received but a solitary
epistle from her. Now, however, every disappointment
was amply redressed. She sat beside me with
her hand in mine, and her soft eyes looking smilingly
up into my face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why,” said I at length, “was so much mystery
preserved respecting your presence here? And
why, after I had recognized you on my first awaking
from delirium, did you order the nurse—for you only
could have done so—to avoid all mention of your
name, to conceal from me in whose house I was?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was a scheme adopted as much from the
orders of the physician as from any other motive.
He feared that the least agitation would bring back
your fever, and he enjoined secresy on the nurse, as
the surest way to keep you composed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I would have said how much he had failed of success
had I not been too full of happiness to condemn
even a formal old physician.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The period of my convalescence is one written on
my inmost heart in characters never to be obliterated.
Oh! those were delicious hours. With Beatrice beside
me I would sit gazing out on the sunny landscape
beneath the window, or wander through the
rich garden which surrounded the chateau. Or perhaps
she would ply her needle while I would read to
her. And then she would sing some of the old songs
of her native land. And by and by the Baroness
would come in, and with her ever sunny mind join in
the conversation. Years, long eventful years, have
passed since then, and God knows too many of those
I loved are now in their graves, but the memory of
that fortnight of happiness never fails to restore gladness
to my heart even in its utmost sorrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But I have too long forgotten the little <span class='sc'>Fire Fly</span>.
It will be recollected that I had left Holland with
the intention of joining my old commander at Paris,
and I now seized the earliest opportunity of communicating
my present situation to him by letter. A
reply soon arrived by which I learned that, although
the <span class='sc'>Fire Fly</span> had been condemned, a brig had been
chartered, and that he intended returning to America
with his officers and most of his crew in her. They
had been in the greatest anxiety respecting my fate,
and had finally given me up for lost. The letter informed
me that the day of sailing had been fixed, and
that before I could return an answer the brig would
have broke ground. My old commander ended by
hoping that I might soon be able to rejoin him in the
United States—although he added a gay postscript
to say that he understood there was great probability
of my choosing another mistress than glory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile I slowly recovered, and as every obstacle
to my union with Beatrice was now removed,
I did not hesitate to press the dear girl to name an
early day for the realization of our nuptials. With
a thousand blushes she referred me to the Baron and
his lady, promising in the softest whisper, as if she
feared to trust herself to speak, to abide by their decision.
Need I say how speedily I availed myself of
the permission, or how warmly I petitioned for as
short a delay as possible?</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length the day was named, and though I was
condemned to wait a whole month, in the company of
Beatrice it glided away almost insensibly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The morning at length dawned. It was a bright
sunny day in early winter, and never shall I forget
the cheery sound of the village bells ringing to announce
my approaching nuptials. The air was keen
and frosty; not a cloud was in the sky; the brown
woods fairly glowed in the sunlight; and, in a word,
had I chosen the day a more fitting one could not
have been selected. My lady readers may expect a
description of the dress of the bride, the carriage,
the feast, and a thousand other things, but as I am
no Sir Charles Grandison, I shall pass them over without
comment. I will only say that Beatrice—my
own Beatrice at last—never looked lovelier than
when she descended to the room, where we were all
awaiting her, on that marriage morn. The smile, the
blush, the look of unreserved affection as her eye was
raised timidly to my face and then dropped, I shall
never forget. The Baron gave her away, the nuptial
vow was said, and with a tumult of feelings I cannot
describe, I pressed her to my bosom, a wife. A tear
was on her cheek, but I kissed it holily away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We remained in France for nearly a year after our
union, and even after that prolonged stay, could
hardly tear ourselves from the Baron and his lady.
But the prospect of peace daily growing stronger we
availed ourselves of the kind offer of the French
monarch, and sailed for America in one of our allies’
frigates. I never, however, served again, for the
war was in fact terminated, but thereafter I spent
my life in the bosom of my family.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the magician after having summoned up and
marshalled before him a phantasmagoria of shadowy
figures, at length perceives them fading from his
sight, and, conscious that the spell is fast departing,
lays down his rod, so we, approaching to the end of
our task, find that the charm is beginning to lose its
power, and that the beings we have conjured up are
melting rapidly from our vision. Even now they
seem to us only as a dream. Yet there is one glimpse
more afforded to us before the magic curtain falls on
them forever. It is that of a happy fireside and a
smiling circle around it. Nor are the principals in
that domestic scene wholly unfamiliar to us, for in
the mild eyes and Madonna-like countenance of the
one, and in the well-known face and embrowned
features of the other, we recognize two of those who
have figured as the chief personages in our story.
Years have not impaired the beauty of Beatrice, for
they have fallen as light on her as blossoms. But
she is not now alone in her loveliness, for at her knee
is one, like and yet unlike her, younger but not more
beautiful, gayer but with scarcely less sweetness.
Need we say of whom the group is composed?</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now, reader, let me drop my disguise and
come before you in my own character as</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> was near midnight, on one of the beautiful summer
evenings that brood over our Western Land, as
some fair spirit hovers near to Paradise—and which
can be realized only by those who have witnessed
them—that one of the numerous strangers that throng
the waters of “La Belle Rivière,” paused on its upward
course before a small town which lay upon the
banks of the aforesaid stream. When the boat had
effected a landing, a few passengers, who either blind
to the charms of Morpheus, or more allied to those
of sundry packs of cards, that strewed the tables of
the “social hall,” stepped upon shore to enjoy a
moonlight view of the village. Among the number,
was a group of three individuals, who, withdrawing
from the rest, strolled carelessly along one of the
principal streets, until they arrived at a cross, turning
down whose short but secluded walk, several
large buildings, evidently the residences of the most
wealthy portion of the inhabitants, were situated.
As they passed into this beautiful and peaceful retreat,
a slight whispering, which presently broke
forth into loud and angry words, disturbed the slumbering
echoes of the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I tell you, Layton, it is impossible! I will not—cannot
do it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Spoken like a fool, and a milksop, as you are;
there is a way to stop your whining scruples, and
curse me if I’ll not show it you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quick as thought, the first speaker turned, and confronting
his companion, exclaimed in a voice trembling
with passion,—“Ay, there <span class='it'>is</span> a way to rouse the
sleeping devil, even in my <span class='it'>coward</span> frame; but your
threats fall regardless on my ear, while I have this
good blade to protect me,”—and a long glittering
Bowie-knife flashed beneath the soft rays of the harvest
moon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By Heavens! I believe you both to be mad! Put
up your knife, Bradley, and you, Layton, keep your
infernal tongue within your teeth, unless you want to
have this goodly town about our ears.” This soothing
speech was spoken by the third, and hitherto silent
companion; and while the altercation is progressing
in lower tones, you, my gentle reader, shall have a
Daguerreotype sketch of at least one of the party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bradley Spencer was the son of one of the most
wealthy and aristocratic planters in Louisiana, but
maternal affection he never knew, at least was not
conscious of it, his mother having been snatched
away in his childhood, by one of the fearful epidemics
peculiar to that portion of the South. His father, a
high-principled, noble-minded man, richly endowed
with the warm blood and chivalrous feelings of the
Southerner, having thus lost that which he considered
as the better part of life, gave his undivided heart to
this “sole scion of his stock,” and for his boy’s sake,
no second lady darkened his halls, or cast a shadow
over the golden sunlight of the young heir’s youthful
existence. Thus fondly nurtured and cherished, every
wish indulged to the utmost, the young Bradley grew
apace; but, with all his paternal prejudice, the elder
Spencer could not but note the wavering acts and vacillating
mind of his darling boy, betokening, even in
youth, the indecision of the man. With prophetic
sorrow, he saw the consequences entailed on one,
who, ever willing to follow, had no projects to offer,
or will of his own, to oppose those of others. To
eradicate this “crying evil,” the boy was sent, at the
age of fifteen, to college. There, at least, argued the
parent, he will learn independence of thought and
expression. But how widely was he mistaken! An
universal favorite among his class-mates, winning
“golden opinions” from all, by his pliant disposition,
and suavity of manners, and being allowed an unlimited
sum for his passing expenditures, he bore the
palm, and reigned any thing but a despot, over his
more firmly-minded companions. It is not our intention
to follow him through the mazes of college life,
and we pass in silence over the four succeeding years,
when at the age of nineteen, he was re-called, to receive
the last blessing and injunctions of a dying
father. Still true to his erroneous system of indulgence,
Mr. Spencer left his property to the undivided
control of his son, fondly imagining, that unlimited
sway would overcome the imbecile principles of
youth, and teach him that firmness of mind, and stability
of purpose, so essential to manhood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Youth is the season of luxury and enjoyment. Joy
is evanescent; and grief, in the young bosom, is but
the sudden o’ercasting of a summer sky; the cloud
passes away, and the bow of promise is bent in the
now smiling heavens. Thus was it with Bradley’s
grief; a few short weeks in New Orleans did wonders;
they initiated him in the mysteries and delights
of the gaming table; they did more: they
introduced him to the lowest haunts of vice and
infamy, cloaked, indeed, for the decoy of this rich
windfall; but so thin and flimsy was the protecting
veil of decency and morality, that any other than
Bradley Spencer’s eyes would have pierced the wily
folds, and laid bare the monsters lurking behind
them. Thus early possessed with the fatal passion
of gaming, night after night saw the infatuated youth
wound deeper and deeper in the toils of his betrayers.
Mortgage after mortgage was given,—though
not having a shadow of legality about them, they
were accepted as eagerly by these human leeches,
as the red gold for which they had sold their souls to
perdition. The men with whom it was Spencer’s
fate to become connected, were most of them from
thirty to forty years of age; wily, unprincipled villains,
well calculated to govern the simple youth,
whom they remorselessly plundered of all at his present
command, and accepted his honor as pledge for
the rest, when he should become of age. Nor were
the months tardy in their flight. At the end of two
short years, his property was formally yielded by his
passive guardian, and the day that gave him house
and land, stock and slave, saw him resign it to the
fiends who had possessed him with a love of all that
was degrading to human nature, and taught him to
scoff at all who were truly poor and virtuous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is the same Bradley Spencer, kind reader,
whose brief career we have endeavored to trace, that
we left in the little village, with his knavish companions,
who, fresh from the hiding places of loathsome
vice, were intent on drawing the young man into yet
greater depths of wickedness. But they struck upon
the wrong chord—Spencer had been culpable, most
culpable, it is true, but he was to himself his worst
foe; he had not willingly injured others, but had
been the dupe, in every instance. Thus, when his
brutal comrade expressed his determination to <span class='it'>rob</span>
one of the habitations before them, and urged his
assistance, his nobler spirit that had slept so long,
was aroused, and he gave vent to his feelings in the
manner we have described.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brief was their consultation, and the arguments
they held with him bade fair to be of no avail, until
the elder and more polite villain, declared that Bradley
could not now withdraw in honor, as they should
suspect he meant to betray them; that they would
not require his assistance, if he had any <span class='it'>foolish</span> prejudice
to the contrary; but he should accompany
them, as a mere looker-on. Without pausing for an
answer, he passed his arm in that of the young man’s,
and followed by Layton, they stepped into a small
yard, at the gable end of one of the mansions. There,
a window had been left open by the unsuspecting
inmates, for the benefit of the air. Springing lightly
in, he was followed by the others. Groping their way
by the light of a dark lantern, which Layton pulled
from the bosom of his coat—thus showing himself
perfectly <span class='it'>au fait</span> in such proceedings—they ascended
a staircase, and pausing in a long passage, bade
Bradley be watchful, and give a low whistle upon
the slightest alarm. The two less scrupulous ruffians
then pursued their way down the passage. What
Spencer’s reflections would have been, he had not
leisure to ascertain, for, fancying he heard a low
breathing, like one in deep slumber, he turned and
discovered, by the light of the moon, which was
streaming in a window near, a door, the which,
on applying his hand, yielded to the impulse. Impelled
by curiosity, or some more definable feeling,
he stepped softly into the room. A night-lamp was
burning dimly upon a table, near a small couch,
where, in her bright and youthful loveliness, slept a
fair girl. Scarce had the breath of sixteen summers
passed over the clear brow that lay upturned in its
marble whiteness, for</p>

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>weighed down the veined lids, the long dark lashes
of which rested on the faintly-tinged cheek beneath.
As Spencer turned from this unexpected vision, his
glance fell on a small book, that lay open on the table.
Some light pencil-mark, that pointed to an admired
passage, drew his attention. As he bent to read, his

<p class='noindent'>a full sense of his degradation, and how he had
“fallen from his high estate,” rushed upon his
stricken heart, and feelings that had slumbered
long, were now fully awakened by the thrilling
lines of the mystical poet, and the strange scene
before him. As he turned quickly to leave where
his presence was a sacrilege, his attention was
caught by a small miniature, one glance at which
showed him the waking likeness of the sleeping
beauty before him. Involuntarily catching it, he
fled from the room, and giving the signal agreed
upon, to his companions, the next moment saw
them wending their way to the boat, which, having
discharged the freight that detained her, was soon
flying upon her onward course.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Three</span> years had passed away, since Bradley
Spencer, leagued with common thieves, accompanied
them on their nefarious night expedition, in the little
village already mentioned. Bradley Spencer, <span class='it'>then</span>
the companion of gamblers and low debauchees, was
<span class='it'>now</span> Henry Murray, the trusted head clerk of one of
the most wealthy mercantile houses in New York.
From the ever memorable night of the robbery, the
wretched young man forsook his unworthy associates.
“Remorse and self-contempt” did indeed cling to
him, and despair and shame at first conquered his
remaining energy. But the spirit was present with
him; it only needed to be roused into action. He
had parted with his last dollar, when he arrived in
New York, and the change of name was decided on
to soothe the pride that came to his aid after so long
a time. Deprivations only rendered him stronger in
his virtuous purposes, thus proving at once the false
system of indulgence adopted by his parent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Clement Archer, Esq., was a stern, unbending, business
man. Strictly moral in his walk before men,
he required all around him to show the same regard
for the welfare of society. With a heart filled with
benevolence, though veiled with an air of sternness,
he received Bradley in his counting-house, as Henry
Murray, knowing it to be a fictitious name, for Spencer
scorned to impose on his benefactor in this respect,
and though Bradley’s past history was a sealed
book which his employer never attempted to pry
into, he could not help fancying some misdemeanor
had driven the young man from his home and friends.
He contented himself, therefore, by placing a strict
watch upon his conduct, but after months had passed
away, indeed, years, and saw Henry the same attentive,
hard-laboring clerk he was at first, his patron
took pleasure in showing him favor, and in placing
the most unlimited confidence in him. Thus had the
three years glided by. That Henry was comparatively
happy, we admit, but many an agonizing night had
passed, ere he acquired even this slight tranquility,
and shall we confess it, kind reader? the stolen
miniature, the witness of his involuntary crime, was
cherished as a precious relic, for instead of serving to
remind him of his errors, and fill him with shame, it
was regarded as a mute angel, that had snatched him
from ignominy and vice. And who could blame him
for loving to look upon that fair countenance, with its
deep and eloquent eyes forever speaking of the intellectual
worth within? It was not so much the beautiful
form of the features, that arrested the gaze, as
the whole-soul expression that shone around them.
Long would the infatuated youth gaze on the memento
of his crime, but there was little penitence in
his looks, and not one thought of sorrow for the grief
the loss of it must have given the fair original, for enclosed
in the back was a braid of dark hair, slightly
silvered with grey, and beneath was engraved, “from
a fond mother to her daughter, on her sixteenth birthday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bradley had carefully avoided every print which
he thought would be likely to contain the intelligence
of the robbery, and as no communication passed
between himself and the perpetrators on this subject,
he was consequently ignorant of the amount abstracted,
or of the names of the sufferers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a cold winter morning, when Mr. Archer
suddenly entered his counting-house and ordered it to
be immediately closed. On Henry’s (for so must we
call him) looking up, he perceived his friend’s countenance
was clothed with grief, and the fresh crape
upon his hat told that death had been busy with his
house. Bidding Henry, who was domesticated in his
family, accompany him home, he informed him he
had just received letters announcing the death of an
only and well-beloved brother, and added, he was
hourly expecting the arrival of an orphan niece, now
committed to his charge. His companion asked no
questions, for fear of stirring the fountain of grief
afresh. On entering the drawing-room at night, he
was presented to Miss Archer, but what was his surprise
and consternation on lifting his eyes to her face,
to see the fair sleeper before him! The face was
paler than the miniature’s, and wore a more chastened
and somewhat older expression, for sorrow had indeed
visited her. Both parents had slept their last sleep,
since she slumbered so unconsciously in his presence.
Stammering forth some faint apologies, Bradley left
the room and the house, and who may say what wild
visions thronged his restless couch that night!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Months glided away, and Mr. Archer beheld, with
some slight misgivings, the growing intimacy between
his niece and Henry. Not but that he would willingly
have given her to his <span class='it'>protégé</span>, could the cloudy
mystery which hung over the young man have been
cleared to his satisfaction. But during the three
years Henry had been with him, he had never received
letter or communication, of any kind, from friend or
foe. For a young man to stand so utterly alone,
“looked strange,” to say the least of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Entering the room one evening, where Miss Archer
and Henry were sitting, her uncle, in a light and
laughing tone, said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How is this, Emily? Young Dalton has been
making serious complaints concerning the obduracy
of heart of an ungrateful niece of mine. What has
he done to provoke her displeasure? ‘and why won’t
she wed?’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, dear uncle, you know my heart and hand
have long been pledged to the restorer of my miniature.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so my Emily stands pledged to a nameless
robber! Would she like it to reach his ear through
the walls of a prison?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Most sincerely do I hope he is free, for he must
be a gentle ruffian, and having stolen naught but my
picture, I can’t find it in my heart to be very angry;
the compliment, dear uncle, only think of the compliment!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay, but the compliment paid to your father was
a little more costly, was it not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With that I have nothing to do,” replied Emily,
blushing; “but I would willingly forgive the robber,
would he restore my mother’s gift,” and the
tears sprang to her eyes, at the mention of her loss.
Mr. Archer saw her emotion, and said no more. But
Bradley, how did he hear the secret? How often was
he tempted, as he heard the beautiful and enthusiastic
girl plead for him so eloquently, and regret the loss
of what was so dear to her, to throw himself on her
mercy and confess all, but happily he restrained his
emotion, and soon after left the apartment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, gentlemen, while you are discussing your
hot rolls and coffee, I will read this delightful retailer
of news and scandal,” exclaimed Miss Archer, on
seating herself at the breakfast table, the morning
succeeding the conversation already detailed. “Here
is ‘latest foreign news,’ ‘home affairs,’ ‘politics’
and ‘poetry;’ which will you have? Ah! let me
see; here is a mysterious affair:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>‘The Governor of Louisiana offers five hundred
dollars reward to any person or persons, who will
intimate any knowledge of the residence of one Bradley
Spencer, or satisfactorily prove that the said
Bradley is living. He having left New Orleans about
three years since, in company with a party of gamblers,
and not having since been heard of, it is feared
by his friends that he has fallen a victim to the machinations
of the said men, as through a confession
lately made by one of the party, who was stabbed in
an affray, Spencer will be restored his property, of
which he was most nefariously deprived. Should
this meet his eye, he is earnestly requested to return
and take possession of the same.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>As Emily read this paragraph in a clear, distinct
voice, Mr. Archer fastened his eye on the young man
who sat at his table. No power on earth could have
controlled Bradley’s emotions, and after the reader
paused, Mr. Archer arose, and taking his hand, said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be candid, Henry; whatever faults you have
been guilty of, these last three years have expiated——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know not the half of my rash acts,” passionately
interrupted the young man; “you would both
loathe and spurn me, were I to tell all; but I <span class='it'>will</span>
perform one just act. Miss Archer,” taking the
miniature from his bosom, “here is the deity that
has preserved me from sin, and before you stands
the—robber!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both Mr. Archer and Emily were mute with surprise
and amazement at this confession; but when
they eagerly questioned him, and learned what he
had to offer in extenuation, it is needless to say he
was freely forgiven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is sufficient to add that Bradley recovered the
major portion of his property, and as he gazes upon
the generous and forgiving girl, who is now his bride,
he invokes blessings on the being who, by the interposition
of a Divine Providence, was the means of
preserving him from the “gambler’s fate.”</p>

<div><h1><a id='marr'></a>THE MARRIAGE OF ACHILLES.</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY THE AUTHOR OF “THE BROTHERS,” “CROMWELL,” “RINGWOOD THE ROVER,” ETC.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> was a day of Truce in the fair Troad!—the
festival of the great Doric and Ionian God, sacred to
either nation—it was a day of general peace, of general
rejoicing! The ninth year of the war was
far advanced toward its termination. Hector, the
mighty prop of Troy, had fallen; yet did the Grecian
host still occupy their guarded camp by the dark waters
of the Hellespont; nor had the indomitable valor
of the Goddess-born prevailed to level with the dust
the towers of Troy divine. For fresh allies had
buckled on their armor for the defence of Priam—Memnon,
son of the morning, like his great rival
half immortal, with his dark Coptic hosts, had rushed
from the far banks of the giant Nile—ill-fated prince
and hero!—rushed, but to swell the triumphs of the
invincible Thessalian, to water with his life-blood
the flowery pastures of the land he vainly hoped to
save. Penthesilea, virgin queen of the man-defying
virgins—fairest of earth’s fair daughters—had left
her boundless plains beside the cold Thermodon—had
called her quivered heroines from warring with
the mountain pard, and chasing the huge urus of the
plain, to launch the unerring shaft and ply the two-edged
axe against the sevenfold shield of Salamis,
against the Pelian spear. Alas! not her did her unrivalled
horsemanship, in which she set her trust—in
which she might have coped successfully with the
world-famed Bellerophontes—not her did her skill
with the feathered reed avail, against the speed of
him who left the winds behind in his career, whose
might was more than human. She too lay prone before
him—the dazzling charms of her voluptuous
bosom revealed to the broad sunshine, as he tore off
the jewelled cincture—tore off the scaly breastplate—the
hyacinthine tresses, soiled in the gory dust—tresses
wherewith she might have veiled her form
even to the ankles, so copious was their flow! Oh
she was beautiful in death—and avenged by her
beauty!—For the fierce conqueror wept and bore her
to his own pavilion, and hung enamored for long days
over those fatal charms; and pressed the cold form to
his fiery heart, and kissed with fervid lips the cold
and senseless eyelids, the mouth that answered not
to his unnatural rapture. The fate of Troy, as on
the bravest of her sons, had fallen on the best of her
allies—the fiat of the destinies had long ago gone
forth—the fiat which the dwellers of Olympus, the
revellers on Nectar and Ambrosia,—which Jove himself,
although he were reluctant, must obey! The
ancestral curse was on the walls of Ilium, and all
who should defend them. They fell there one by
one, valiant, sometimes victorious—Sarpedon, Cyenus
fell—Memnon, Penthesilea! Yet falling they
deferred the ruin which they might not avert—so
Troy still stood, although her mightiest were down—and
when the brazen cymbals of Cybele summoned
her sons to battle, they still rushed forth in throngs,
determined to the last and unsubdued; and with
Deiphobus to lead—worthy successor of their mightier
hero—they battled it still bravely on the plain,
between the city and the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But now it was all harmony and peace!—the
spears were pitched into the yellow sand beside the
Grecian galleys, or hung, each on its owner’s wall,
within the gates of Ilium. The plain, the whole fair
plain, was crowded now—more densely crowded
than it had ever showed, when in the deadliest fight
the kindred nations mingled—for now not warriors
only, but the whole population of the camp, the country
and the town, traversed its grassy surface in gay
and gorgeous companies. Gray headed men were
there, counsellors and contemporaries of old Priam,
eager to look upon the field whereon such exploits
had been done—matrons come out to weep above
the green graves of their sons and spouses, graves
which till then they ne’er had visited, nor decked with
votive garlands, nor watered with a tear—maidens
in all the frolic mirth of their blythe careless youth,
panting to gather flowrets from the green banks of
Simois and Xanthus, Phrygian streams, to chase the
gaudy butterfly, to listen to the carol of the bird—to
drink in with enchanted ears the sylvan harmonies
from which they had so long been shut within
the crowded walls of the beleaguered city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a wondrous spectacle—Yea! beautiful exceedingly!
Men in those days were indeed images
of the immortal—women, types of ideal loveliness!—many
a form was there of youthful warriors, such
as were models unto him who wrought from the inanimate
rock of Paros, that breathing, deathless god,
the slayer of the Python—many a girlish shape such
as we worship in the poet’s dream, Psyche, or Hebe,
or Europa—many a full blown figure, ripe in the
perfect luxury of womanhood, such as enchants the
eyes, intoxicates the hearts, enthrals the souls, of all
who look upon the Medicean Venus. Then the rich
oriental garbs—the half transparent robes of gauze-like
Byssus, revealing <span class='it'>all</span> the symmetry, and <span class='it'>half</span>
the delicate hues, of the rich charms they seemed to
veil—the jewelled zones and mitres, the golden
network, scarce restraining the downward sweep of
the redundant ringlets!—the priests in stoles of
purest snow, sandalled and crowned with gold!—the
sacrificers in their garbs succinct—the spotless,
flower-crowned victims!—the music—and the
odors!—and the song! The wild exulting bursts of
the mad Bacchic Dithyramb!—the statelier and more
solemn chant, warbled by hundred tongues of boys
and stainless virgins, in honor of the Pure, Immaculate
God—the silver-bowed—the light-producer—the
golden-haired, and yellow-sworded—the healer—the
averter—the avenger!—son of Latona and
of Jove—Delian and Thymbrœan King!—the blast
of the shrill trumpets, blent with the deep, deep roll
of the Corybantian drum, loud as the deafening roar
of subterranean thunder, and the sharp clashing of the
Cretan cymbal, and the shrill rattle of the systrum!
the chariots and the coursers of the god!—chariots
of polished brass, reflecting every beam of the broad
Asiatic sun till they seemed cars of living flame—coursers
of symmetry unmatched, snow-white, with
full spirit-flashing eyes, and nostrils wide distended,
trampling the flowery sod as if they were proud of
their golden trappings, and conscious of the God their
owner!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Far in a haunted grove, beneath the towering heights
of Ida, where never yet, during the whole nine years
of deadly strife, had the red hand of war intruded—far
in a haunted grove, whither no beam of the broad
day-god pierces even from his meridian height—so
densely is it set with the eternal verdure of the laurel,
high over-canopied by green immortal palm—so
closely do the amorous vines embrace both palm and
laurel weaving a vault of solid everlasting greenery—where
the perpetual chant of the nightingale is mingled
only with the faint sigh of the breeze that plays
forever among the emerald alleys, and the sweet tinkling
voice of the Thymbrœan rill, cold from its icy
cradle on the cloud-curtained hill of Jove—unvisited
by feet of profane visitor, stands the secluded
shrine of the Pure God—a circular vault of whitest
Parian marble, reared on twelve Doric shafts, their
pedestals and bases of bright virgin gold. Beneath
the centre of the dome is placed a circular altar of
the same chaste materials, wrought with the most
superb reliefs, descriptive of the birth, the exploits,
and the histories of the great Deity—and in a niche
immediately behind it—the Deity himself—the
naked limbs—all grace and youthful beauty—the
swell of the elastic muscles, the life-like, almost
breathing protrusion of the expanded chest—the swan-like
curvature of the proud neck, the scornful curl
of the almost girlish lips, the wide indignant nostril,
the corded veins of the broad forehead from which
the clustered locks stream back, waved as it were by
some spiritual breath prophetic, the lightning glance
of the triumphant eye shot from beneath the brows
half bended in a frown, proclaimed the Python killer—the
Boy-god now in the flush of his first triumph!— The
fierceness kindled by the perilous strife was not
yet faded from the eye—yet he smiles, scornfully
smiles, at the very ease with which he has prevailed
over his dragon foe!</p>

<p class='pindent'>A dim religious twilight reigned through that solemn
shrine; it would have been a solemn darkness,
but for the pencils of soft emerald-colored light,
which streamed down here and there full of bright
wandering motes, among the tangled foliage—and
for the pale transparent glow soaring up from the
marble altar, whereon fed by the richest spices and
the most generous wine, the sacred flame played to
and fro, lambent and imitative of the lights that stud
the empyrean.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Splendid, however, as was the picture offered by
the interior of the shrine, decked with all those appliances
that operate most strongly on the mind, or
at least on the imaginative portion of the mind of
man—pervading all the senses with a calm, sweet,
luxurious languor—filling the soul with strange voluptuous
fantasies—half poetry, half superstition;
yet infinitely were all the splendors, all the elegance
of the spot surpassed by the transcendant majesty
of those who stood around the altar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the right hand and left, next to the statue of
Apollo, ministered the chief pontiffs of that solemn
and mysterious deed; they were both old, even
beyond the usual old age of mortals, yet perfectly
erect and stately in their forms—their long locks
were indeed of perfect silvery whiteness, their wide
expanded foreheads wrinkled with many a line and
furrow, their lips pale as ashes, their whole complexion
bloodless!—yet did their eyes beam out
from the deep cavernous recesses of their sockets
with a wild and spirited brilliance that savored not a
little of the unearthly light of inspiration; and their
whole air and bearing went far to denote that their
long years had nought diminished the pervading powers
of the soul, though they had wasted not a little
the mere mortal clay; but rather had given freer
scope to the far-darting mind, in limiting the operations
of the coarser matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their robes were white immaculate linen, and
they wore chaplets of the green bay tree on their
heads, and carried sceptres in their hands of gold,
enwreathed with sprays of laurels, and bound with
woollen fillets. All motionless they stood, and silent;
stirring not hand, nor foot, nor even so much as
winking an eyelid, save when they poured the fat
spiced wine from golden pateræ upon the altar, to
feed the sacred flame. Behind them were assembled
the ministers, the choristers, and sacrifices of the
temple, waking at times wild harmonies from many
a golden lyre, many a silver flute; while, to fill up
the pauses between the bursts of instrumental music,
soft symphonies arose from virgin lips invisible,
singing, “all glory to unshorn Apollo, and her, the
sister of his soul, the unstained goddess of the groves—queen
of the silver bow!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little way advanced by the right hand of the
altar, bowed down by many years and many sorrows,
yet still serene, and dignified, and king-like—for he
was yet a king!—aye, and in after days, when his
Troy sunk in ashes never to rise again, a king he
died, right kingly—leaning on his ivory staff stood
the great offspring of Laomedon—good, hapless Priam.
His limbs, which had been framed in the gigantic
mould of the old heroic ages, still larger than the
degenerate thews of his descendants, were all relaxed
and nerveless; and the great veins and sinews, which
stood out upon his shrivelled hands like a network of
cordage, betokened the vast strength which once must
have dwelt in that large frame, so sinewless and feeble
now—so impotent and helpless. His golden crown
was on his lofty brow, serene and venerable in its polished
baldness—a flowing mantle of rich regal purple,
lined with white lambskins, flowed down from his
shoulders and swept the marble pavement with its rich
broidered edge and bullion fringes—a tunic of white
linen, gathered about his waist by a broad belt of golden
arabesques, sandals of purple leather clasped and
embossed with gold, completed his attire—while,
ministers of regal state, the god-like heralds stood
behind him, Jalthybius, and Eurybates the sage—messengers
of high kings, interpreters of gods, clad
in their mystic garments, and bearing high, advanced
their sacred rods, the emblems of their office—close
around these were gathered the councillors and sages
of the city, Antenor, and Ucalegon, and wise Anchises—reverend
and grave seniors, who, having long laid
by the falchion, now governed by their proved experience
the realm which they had formerly protected
by their enthusiastic valor—near these a dozen
slaves—slaves of the royal palace, waited with offerings
for the altar; two snow-white lambs, two
vases of rich wine, and frankincense, and myrrh,
aloes and cassia—garments of needle-work, and garlands
of rich flowers, and crowns and sceptres of
wrought gold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon the other hand, facing her aged father, was
one whom but to look upon, would have excited the
coldest, dullest heart to passionate, enamored phrenzy—the
young, the beautiful Polyxena, the destined
bride of the goddess-born—the bravest of the brave,
the noblest of the noble, victor of victors, unsurpassed
of men, magnificent Achilles. He had beheld
her first, before her gallant brother fell, by his hand,
beside the Scæan gates, while with her aged mother,
and mad Cassandra and her train, she was engaged
in mystic rites upon the plain—beheld and loved
upon the instant! A few days had elapsed—days
of fierce strife between his patriotism and his passion—and
then he had demanded of his good, gallant
enemy, pledge of conciliation and of peace, the hand
of his sweet sister. Oh! demand frantically rejected;
oh! pledge of peace madly refused, and fatally!
For fate it was, the damning fate of Troy, that steeled
the heart of Hector!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Achilles had all-honorably proposed peace; Hector
demanded treason—treason to Greece and the
confederates, as the sole price of young Polyxena!
The reply of the indignant Greek was renewed war—and
Hector fell, and Troy quailed to its base and tottered!
Then Memnon buckled on his armor for
Troy, and he too fell! Penthesilea, and she likewise!—and
now, all her chief captains down, all her allies
retired, Troy was again in her extremity, and again—peaceable
and courteous as he was fierce and valiant
in the field—Achilles offered terms, peace for Polyxena.
And now his terms were heard;—for they were
old heads now to whom he made his proffers—heard
and accepted. And here, in the Thymbrœan shrine,
they met to plight their faith upon the treaties—to
solemnize the marriage of Achilles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was indeed most exquisite in her young loveliness;
words cannot tell her loveliness. Scarce sixteen
years of age, yet a mature and perfect woman;
mature in the voluptuous development of her unrivalled
person; mature in the development of her
luxurious oriental nature. Tall, slender, and erect
as the graceful palm of her native plains, her figure
was yet admirably moulded; her ample sloping
shoulders; her full glowing bust, tapering downward
to a waist scarcely a span in circuit, and thence the
sweeping swell of her full lower limbs down to the
sylph-like ankle and small, delicate foot, that peered
out from beneath the golden fringes of her nuptial
robe, constituted, in fact, the very perfection of ideal
female symmetry. Her snow-white, swan-like neck
languidly drooping with a graceful curve, like a white
lily’s stalk when the sweet chalice is surcharged with
summer dew, concealed, but could not hide the beauty
of her head and features; the clean and classic outlines
of the smooth brow, from which the auburn
hair, parted in two broad, massive braids, waved off
behind the small white ears, and there was clustered
in a full bunch of ringlets, was relieved by the well
marked arches of her dark eye-brows—the eyes
themselves could not be seen, for modestly were they
cast down upon the pavement; though now and then
a stolen glance toward her lover would flash out from
beneath the long, long jetty lashes, like the gleam of
a war-sword leaping from its scabbard, or the lightning
from the gloom of the thunder cloud. Her cheeks
were pale as the snow on Ida—save when a rich
carnation flush, emblem of overmastering passion,
would suffuse brow, and cheeks, and neck, and bosom—aye,
and the moulded curves of those smooth ivory
shoulders, with a transparent transitory glow as rich,
and, oh! as evanescent as the bright hues of sunset
touching the top of some heaven-kissing hill! A
wreath of orange flowers, blended with myrtle—sacred
plant of Venus,—even then the bridal wreath—encompassed
the fair temples, and shone out resplendently
from the dark tresses of the auburn hair.
The nuptial veil—a tissue as it were, of woven air,
gemmed with bright golden stars—fell off in graceful
waves, and floated down her back till it spread
out in a long train upon the marble floor; her robe of
the like gauzy tissue, fastened on either shoulder by
a large stud of brilliants, covered, but veiled not the
beauties of her voluptuous bosom; below her bust,
plaited in massy folds, it was confined by the virgin
zone, and thence flowed down five several tunics,
each shorter than that next below it, each fringed
with golden tassels, and looped with golden cords,
down to her golden sandals. Behind her stood Cassandra,
clad in one plain, close-fitting stole of linen,
with her dark locks dishevelled, streaming in strange
disorder about her rich, majestic person; a laurel
wreath set carefully upon her head, and a large branch
of the same tree in her right hand. Her full dark
eye, that gleamed so often with the intolerable lustre
of prophetic phrenzy, was now suffused with moisture,
languid, abstracted, and even sad; but no such
wo-begone expression sat on the brows or on the
laughing lips of the attendant maidens, who clustered,
a bright bevy of girlish forms and lovely
nymph-like faces behind the beauteous bride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just before the altar, facing the image of the god,
scarce less sublimely beautiful than that unrivalled
marble, alone, and unadorned, and unattended, behold
the glorious bridegroom! Language may not describe
the splendor, the almost intolerable glory of
his soul-fraught, enthusiastic eye—the ardor of the
warrior; the inspiration of the host, the <span class='it'>œstrum</span> of
the prophet when he is fullest of his god, were all
combined in that spirit-flashing feature. You saw
that eye, and you saw all—the chiselled outlines of
the nose, the generous expansive nostril, the proud
voluptuous lip, were all unseen, all lost, all swallowed
up in the pervading glory of that immortal eye. His
form was such as <span class='it'>must</span> have been the form of him
who could outstrip the speed of the most fiery coursers;
bounding along all armed, in his full panoply
of gold, beside the four horse chariot; although the
mettled chargers strained every nerve to conquer—although
Eumelus drove them. His garb was simple
even to plainness; a short and narrow tunic of bright
crimson cloth, leaving his mighty limbs exposed in
their own glorious beauty, was belted round his waist
by a small cord of gold—his head was covered only
by its long silky tresses; sandals of gold were on his
feet; he wore no weapons, but a long oaken sceptre
studded with knobs of gold, supported his right
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such was the glorious group which tenanted the
shrine of the Thymbrœan god on that auspicious day—such
was the ceremonial of Achilles’ marriage!
Yet was it passing strange that not one of the Grecian
chiefs stood by the bravest of their nation, his comrade
and his friend on that sublime occasion; it was
yet stranger that not one of all her noble brethren,
not one of Priam’s fifty sons stood by their lovely
sister. Yet such had been the will of Priam; and
with the noble confidence—the proud contempt,
which were a portion of his nature—confidence in
his own dauntless and unrivalled valor, contempt
of any mortal peril, Achilles had acceded to the
terms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now the rites were finished—the sacrifice
complete—the bridal chorus chanted! The pontiffs
slew two lambs; one for the royal prince—one for
the princely bridegroom—and filled two cups of
wine, and they, the sire and son, touched the dead
lambs and raised the wine-cups, and grasped each
other’s hand in amity, and swore eternal peace, eternal
amity, and love! They stretched their right
hands to the god, tasted the wine, and poured the red
libations over the holy altar—praying aloud—solemn
and awful prayer—“that thus <span class='it'>his</span> blood should
flow upon the earth—<span class='it'>his</span> own life-blood, his wife’s,
his child’s, and that of all his race—who should the
first transgress that solemn vow and treaty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They swore, and it was ended! The hero turned
to clasp his blooming bride—— Whence—what—was
that keen twang—keen, shrill, and piercing,
which broke the hush of feeling, that followed on
that awful oath sworn between noble foes, now foes
no longer? Why does Achilles start with a convulsive
shudder! He reels, he staggers, he falls head-long—and
see the arrow—fell and accursed deed—buried
up to the very feather in the right heel of the
prostrate hero! There was a moment’s pause—<span class='it'>one</span>
moment’s!—and then, with the bow in his left hand,
and the broad falchion gleaming in his right, forth
from among the priests—forth from the inmost
shrine—forth leaped the traitor Paris! Deiphobus,
the warrior—Helenus, the priest, followed!—all
armed from head to foot, all with their weapons bare
and ready! There was one frantic cry—the
shriek of the heart-broken bride—and then no other
sound except the clash of the weapons, driven sheer
through the body of the hero, against the desecrated
pavement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thus Hector is avenged—thus is Troy freed”—shouted
the slaughterers of the mighty Greek; but if
the shade of Hector was so appeased by a base vengeance,
yet so was Troy not freed! For not long
afterward, the flames rolled over it, that even its ruins
perished, its site was lost forever!—and if Polyxena
was then snatched from her spouse, yet, when in after
days her living form was immolated on his tomb—their
manes were united, never to part again, in the
Elysian fields—the Islands of the Blessed.</p>

<div><h1><a id='auto'></a>A CHAPTER ON AUTOGRAPHY.</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i049.jpg' alt='Signature of Edgar A. Poe' id='iid-0005' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>[In this, our second “Chapter on Autography,”
we conclude the article and the year together. When
we say that so complete a collection has never been
published before, we assert only that which is obvious;
and we are pleased to see that our exertions
upon this head have been well received. As we
claim only the sorry merit of the compiler, we shall
be permitted to say that no Magazine paper has ever
excited greater interest than the one now concluded.
To all readers it has seemed to be welcome—but especially
so to those who themselves dabble in the
waters of Helicon:—to those and their innumerable
friends. The diligence required in getting together
these autographs has been a matter of no little moment,
and the expense of the whole undertaking will
be at once comprehended; but we intend the article
merely as an earnest of what we shall do next year.
Our aim shall be to furnish our friends with variety,
originality, and <span class='it'>piquancy</span>, without any regard to labor
or to cost.]</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i050a.jpg' alt='Signature of F W Thomas' id='iid-0006' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>F. W. <span class='sc'>Thomas</span>, who began his literary career, at the
early age of seventeen, by a poetical lampoon upon
certain Baltimore fops, has since more particularly
distinguished himself as a novelist. His “Clinton
Bradshawe” is perhaps better known than any of his
later fictions. It is remarkable for a frank, unscrupulous
portraiture of men and things, in high life and
low, and by unusual discrimination and observation
in respect to character. Since its publication he has
produced “East and West” and “Howard Pinckney,”
neither of which seem to have been so popular
as his first essay; although both have merit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“East and West,” published in 1836, was an attempt
to portray the every-day events occurring to a fallen
family emigrating from the East to the West. In it,
as in “Clinton Bradshawe,” most of the characters
are drawn from life. “Howard Pinckney” was published
in 1840.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Thomas was, at one period, the editor of the
Cincinnati “Commercial Advertiser.” He is also
well known as a public lecturer on a variety of topics.
His conversational powers are very great. As a poet,
he has also distinguished himself. His “Emigrant”
will be read with pleasure by every person of taste.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His MS. is more like that of Mr. Benjamin than
that of any other literary person of our acquaintance.
It has even more than the occasional nervousness of
Mr. B.’s, and, as in the case of the editor of the
“New World,” indicates the passionate sensibility
of the man.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i050b.jpg' alt='Signature of T. G. Spear' id='iid-0007' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Thomas G. Spear</span> is the author of various poetical
pieces which have appeared from time to time in our
Magazines and other periodicals. His productions
have been much admired, and are distinguished for
pathos, and grace. His MS. is well shown in the
signature. It is too <span class='it'>clerky</span> for our taste.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i051.jpg' alt='Signature of R Morris' id='iid-0008' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Morris</span> ranks, we believe, as the first of our
Philadelphia poets, since the death of Willis Gaylord
Clark. His compositions, like those of his late lamented
friend, are characterised by sweetness rather
than strength of versification, and by tenderness
and delicacy rather than by vigor or originality of
thought. A late notice of him in the “Boston Notion,”
from the pen of Rufus W. Griswold, did his
high qualities no more than justice. As a prose
writer, he is chiefly known by his editorial contributions
to the Philadelphia “Inquirer,” and by occasional
essays for the Magazines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His chirography is usually very illegible, although
at times sufficiently distinct. It has no marked characteristics,
and like that of almost every editor in
the country, has been so modified by the circumstances
of his position, as to afford no certain indication
of the mental features.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i052a.jpg' alt='Signature of E. Holden' id='iid-0009' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Ezra Holden</span> has written much, not only for his
paper, “The Saturday Courier,” but for our periodicals
generally, and stands high in the public estimation,
as a sound thinker, and still more particularly
as a fearless expresser of his thoughts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His MS. (which we are constrained to say is a
shockingly bad one, and whose general features may
be seen in his signature,) indicates the frank and naïve
manner of his literary style—a style which not unfrequently
flies off into whimsicalities.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i052b.jpg' alt='Signature of Benjn Matthias' id='iid-0010' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Matthias</span> is principally known by his editorial
conduct of the “Saturday Chronicle” of Philadelphia,
to which he has furnished much entertaining
and instructive matter. His MS. would be generally
termed a fine one, but it affords little indication of
mental character.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i053a.jpg' alt='Signature of Geo R Graham' id='iid-0011' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Graham</span> is known to the literary world as the
editor and proprietor of “Graham’s Magazine,” the
most popular periodical in America, and also of the
“Saturday Evening Post,” of Philadelphia. For
both of these journals he has written much and well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His MS. generally, is very bad, or at least very
illegible. At times it is sufficiently distinct, and has
force and picturesqueness, speaking plainly of the
<span class='it'>energy</span> which particularly distinguishes him as a
man. The signature above is more scratchy than usual.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i053b.jpg' alt='Signature of W. L Stone' id='iid-0012' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Colonel <span class='sc'>Stone</span>, the editor of the New York “Commercial
Advertiser,” is remarkable for the great difference
which exists between the apparent public
opinion respecting his abilities, and the real estimation
in which he is privately held. Through his paper,
and a bustling activity always prone to thrust
itself forward, he has attained an unusual degree of
influence in New York, and, not only this, but what
appears to be a reputation for talent. But this talent
we do not remember ever to have heard assigned him
by any honest man’s private opinion. We place him
among our <span class='it'>literati</span>, because he has published certain
books. Perhaps the best of these are his “Life of
Brandt,” and “Life and Times of Red Jacket.” Of
the rest, his story called “Ups and Downs,” his defence
of Animal Magnetism, and his pamphlets concerning
Maria Monk, are scarcely the most absurd.
His MS. is heavy and sprawling, resembling his mental
character in a species of utter unmeaningness,
which lies, like the nightmare, upon his autograph.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i055a.jpg' alt='Signature of Jared Sparks' id='iid-0013' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The labors of Mr. <span class='sc'>Sparks</span>, Professor of History at
Harvard, are well known and justly appreciated. His
MS. has an unusually odd appearance. The characters
are large, round, black, irregular, and perpendicular—the
signature, as above, being an excellent
specimen of his chirography in general. In all his
letters now before us, the lines are as close together
as possible, giving the idea of irretrievable confusion;
still none of them are illegible upon close inspection.
We can form no guess in regard to any
mental peculiarities from Mr. Sparks’ MS., which
has been no doubt modified by the hurrying and intricate
nature of his researches. We might imagine
such epistles as these to have been written in extreme
haste by a man exceedingly busy among great
piles of books and papers, huddled up around him
like the chaotic tomes of Magliabechi. The paper
used in all our epistles is uncommonly fine.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i055b.jpg' alt='Signature of H. S. Legare' id='iid-0014' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The name of <span class='sc'>H. S. Legare</span> is written without an
accent on the final <span class='it'>e</span>, yet is pronounced, as if this letter
were accented,—Legray. He contributed many
articles of high merit to the “Southern Review,” and
has a wide reputation for scholarship and talent. His
MS. resembles that of Mr. Palfrey, of the North
American Review, and their mental features appear
to us nearly identical. What we have said in regard
to the chirography of Mr. Palfrey will apply with
equal force to that of the present Secretary.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i056a.jpg' alt='Signature of R W Griswold' id='iid-0015' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Griswold</span> has written much, but chiefly in the
editorial way, whether for the papers, or in books.
He is a gentleman of fine taste and sound judgment.
His knowledge of American literature, in all its details,
is not exceeded by that of any man among us.
He is not only a polished prose writer, but a poet of
no ordinary power; although, as yet, he has not put
himself much in the way of the public admiration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His MS. is by no means a good one. It appears unformed,
and vacillates in a singular manner; so that
nothing can be predicated from it, except a certain
unsteadiness of purpose.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i056b.jpg' alt='Signature of George Lunt' id='iid-0016' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. <span class='sc'>George Lunt</span>, of Newburyport, Massachusetts,
is known as a poet of much vigor of style and
massiveness of thought. He delights in the grand,
rather than in the beautiful, and is not unfrequently
turgid, but never feeble. The traits here described,
impress themselves with remarkable distinctness
upon his chirography, of which the signature gives
a perfect idea.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i056c.jpg' alt='Signature of Jos R Chandler' id='iid-0017' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Chandler’s</span> reputation as the editor of one of
the best daily papers in the country, and as one of our
finest <span class='it'>belles lettres</span> scholars, is deservedly high. He
is well known through his numerous addresses, essays,
miscellaneous sketches, and prose tales. Some
of these latter evince imaginative powers of a superior
order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His MS. is not fairly shown in his signature, the
latter being much more open and bold than his general
chirography. His hand-writing must be included
in the editorial category—it seems to have been ruined
by habitual hurry.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i057.jpg' alt='Signature of Fitzgerald Tasistro' id='iid-0018' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Count <span class='sc'>L. Fitzgerald Tasistro</span> has distinguished
himself by many contributions to the periodical literature
of the day, and by his editorial conduct of the
“Expositor,”—a critical journal of high merit in
many respects, although somewhat given to verbiage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His MS. is remarkable for a scratchy diminutiveness,
and is by no means legible. We are not sufficiently
cognizant of his literary character, to draw
any parallel between it and his chirography. His
signature is certainly a most remarkable one.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i058a.jpg' alt='Signature of H. T. Tuckerman' id='iid-0019' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>H. T. Tuckerman</span> has written one or two books
consisting of “Sketches of Travel.” His “Isabel”
is, perhaps, better known than any of his productions,
but was never a popular work. He is a <span class='it'>correct</span> writer
so far as mere English is concerned, but an insufferably
tedious and dull one. He has contributed much
of late days to the “Southern Literary Messenger,”
with which journal, perhaps, the legibility of his MS.
has been an important, if not the principal recommendation.
His chirography is neat and distinct,
and has some grace, but no force—evincing, in a remarkable
degree, the idiosyncrasies of the writer.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Bryan</span> has written some very excellent poetry,
and is appreciated by all admirers of “the good
old Goldsmith school.” He is, at present, postmaster
at Alexandria, and has held the office for many
years, with all the good fortune of a Vicar of Bray.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His MS. is a free, sloping, and regular one, with
more boldness than force, and not ungraceful. He is
fond of <span class='it'>underscoring</span> his sentences; a habit exactly
parallel with the argumentative nature of some of
his best poems.</p>

<img src='images/i059a.jpg' alt='Signature of L A Godey' id='iid-0021' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Godey</span> is only known to the literary world as
editor and publisher of “The Lady’s Book;” but his
celebrity in this regard entitles him to a place in
this collection. His MS. is remarkably distinct and
graceful; the signature affording an excellent idea of
it. The man who invariably writes so well as Mr.
G. invariably does, gives evidence of a fine taste,
combined with an indefatigability which will ensure
his permanent success in the world’s affairs. No man
has warmer friends or fewer enemies.</p>

<img src='images/i059b.jpg' alt='Signature of John S Du Solle' id='iid-0022' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Du Solle</span> is well known, through his connection
with the “Spirit of the Times.” His prose is
forcible, and often excellent in other respects. As a
poet, he is entitled to higher consideration. Some of
his Pindaric pieces are unusually good, and it maybe
doubted if we have a better <span class='it'>versifier</span> in America.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Accustomed to the daily toil of an editor, he has
contracted a habit of writing hurriedly, and his MS.
varies with the occasion. It is impossible to deduce
any inferences from it, as regards the mental character.
The signature shows rather how he can write,
than how he does.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i060a.jpg' alt='Signature of J S French' id='iid-0023' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. <span class='sc'>French</span> is the author of a “Life of David
Crockett”, and also of a novel called “Elkswatawa”,
a denunciatory review of which in the “Southern
Messenger,” some years ago, deterred him from
further literary attempts. Should he write again, he
will probably distinguish himself, for he is unquestionably
a man of talent. We need no better evidence
of this than his MS., which speaks of force,
boldness, and originality. The flourish, however, betrays
a certain <span class='it'>floridity</span> of taste.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i060b.jpg' alt='Signature of Theo. S. Fay' id='iid-0024' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The author of “Norman Leslie” and “The Countess
Ida”, has been more successful as an essayist
about small matters, than as a novelist. “Norman
Leslie” is more familiarly remembered as “The
Great Used Up”, while “The Countess” made no
definite impression whatever. Of course we are not
to expect remarkable features in Mr. Fay’s MS. It
has a wavering, finicky, and over-delicate air, without
pretension to either grace or force; and the description
of the chirography would answer, without
alteration, for that of the literary character. Mr. F.
frequently employs an amanuensis, who writes a very
beautiful French hand. The one must not be confounded
with the other.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i061a.jpg' alt='Signature of J K Mitchell' id='iid-0025' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. <span class='sc'>Mitchell</span> has published several pretty songs
which have been set to music, and become popular.
He has also given to the world a volume of poems,
of which the longest was remarkable for an old-fashioned
polish and vigor of versification. His MS. is
rather graceful than picturesque or forcible—and
these words apply equally well to his poetry in general.
The signature indicates the hand.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i061b.jpg' alt='Signature of Geo.P.Morris' id='iid-0026' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>General <span class='sc'>Morris</span> has composed many songs which
have taken fast hold upon the popular taste, and
which are deservedly celebrated. He has caught the
true <span class='it'>tone</span> for these things, and hence his popularity—a
popularity which his enemies would fain make us
believe is altogether attributable to his editorial influence.
The charge is true only in a measure. The
tone of which we speak is that kind of frank, free,
hearty <span class='it'>sentiment</span> (rather than philosophy) which distinguishes
Béranger, and which the critics, for want
of a better term, call <span class='it'>nationality</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His MS. is a simple unornamented hand, rather rotund
than angular, very legible, forcible, and altogether
in keeping with his style.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i062.jpg' alt='Signature of George H Calvert' id='iid-0027' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Calvert</span> was at one time principal editor of
the “Baltimore American,” and wrote for that journal
some good paragraphs on the common topics of the
day. He has also published many translations from
the German, and one or two original poems—among
others an imitation of Don Juan called “Pelayo,”
which did him no credit. He is essentially a feeble and
common-place writer of poetry, although his prose
compositions have a certain degree of merit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His chirography indicates the “common-place” upon
which we have commented. It is a very usual,
scratchy, and tapering clerk’s hand—a hand which
no man of talent ever did or could indite, unless
compelled by circumstances of more than ordinary
force. The signature is far better than the general
manuscript of his epistles.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i063a.jpg' alt='Signature of J Evans Snodgrass' id='iid-0028' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. <span class='sc'>Snodgrass</span> was at one time the associate of
Mr. Brooks in the “Baltimore Museum”, a monthly
journal published in the City of Monuments some
years since. He wrote for that Magazine, and has
occasionally written for others, articles which possessed
the merit of precision of style, and a metaphysical
cast of thought. We like his prose much
better than his poetry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His chirography is bad—stiff,
sprawling and illegible, with frequent corrections
and interlineations, evincing inactivity not less
than fastidiousness. The signature betrays a meretricious
love of effect.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i063b.jpg' alt='Signature of J N McJilton' id='iid-0029' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. <span class='sc'>McJilton</span> is better known from his contributions
to the journals of the day than from any book-publications.
He has much talent, and it is not improbable
that he will hereafter distinguish himself,
although as yet he has not composed anything of
length which, as a whole, can be styled good.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His MS. is not unlike that of Dr. Snodgrass, but it is
somewhat clearer and better. We can predicate little
respecting it, beyond a love of exaggeration and
<span class='it'>bizarrerie</span>.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i064a.jpg' alt='Signature of W. D. Gallagher' id='iid-0030' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Gallagher</span> is chiefly known as a poet. He is
the author of some of our most popular songs, and
has written many long pieces of high but unequal
merit. He has the true spirit, and will rise into a just
distinction hereafter. His manuscript tallies well
with our opinion. It is a very fine one—clear, bold,
decided and picturesque. The signature above does
not convey, in full force, the general character of his
chirography, which is more rotund, and more decidedly
placed upon the paper.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i064b.jpg' alt='Signature of Richard H Dana' id='iid-0031' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Dana</span> ranks among our most eminent poets,
and he has been the frequent subject of comment in
our Reviews. He has high qualities, undoubtedly,
but his defects are many and great.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His MS. resembles that of Mr. Gallagher very
nearly, but is somewhat more rolling, and has less
boldness and decision. The literary traits of the two
gentlemen are very similar, although Mr. Dana is by
far the more polished writer, and has a scholarship
which Mr. Gallagher wants.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i065.jpg' alt='Signature of M McMichael' id='iid-0032' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. <span class='sc'>McMichael</span> is well known to the Philadelphia
public by the number and force of his prose compositions,
but he has seldom been tempted into book publication.
As a poet, he has produced some remarkably
vigorous things. We have seldom seen a finer
composition than a certain celebrated “Monody.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His MS., when not hurried, is graceful and flowing,
without picturesqueness. At times it is totally illegible.
His chirography is one of those which have
been so strongly modified by circumstances that it is
nearly impossible to predicate any thing with certainty
respecting them.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i066.jpg' alt='Signature of N C Brooks' id='iid-0033' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. <span class='sc'>N. C. Brooks</span> has acquired some reputation as
a Magazine writer. His serious prose is often very
good—is always well-worded—but in his comic attempts
he fails, without appearing to be aware of his
failure. As a poet he has succeeded far better. In
a work which he entitled “Scriptural Anthology”
among many inferior compositions of length, there
were several shorter pieces of great merit:—for example
“Shelley’s Obsequies” and “The Nicthanthes”.
Of late days we have seen little from his
pen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His MS. has much resemblance to that of Mr. Bryant,
although altogether it is a better hand, with
much more freedom and grace. With care Mr.
Brooks can write a fine MS. just as with care he can
compose a fine poem.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i067a.jpg' alt='Signature of Thos H. Stockton' id='iid-0034' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Rev. <span class='sc'>Thomas H. Stockton</span> has written many
pieces of fine poetry, and has lately distinguished
himself as the editor of the “Christian World.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His MS. is fairly represented by his signature, and
bears much resemblance to that of Mr. N. C. Brooks,
of Baltimore. Between these two gentlemen there
exists also, a remarkable similarity, not only of
thought, but of personal bearing and character. We
have already spoken of the peculiarities of Mr. B’s
chirography.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i067b.jpg' alt='Signature of C.W. Thomson' id='iid-0035' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Thompson</span> has written many short poems, and
some of them possess merit. They are characterized
by tenderness and grace. His MS. has some resemblance
to that of Professor Longfellow, and by many
persons would be thought a finer hand. It is clear,
legible and open—what is called a rolling hand. It
has too much tapering, and too much variation between
the weight of the hair strokes and the downward
ones, to be forcible or picturesque. In all those
qualities which we have pointed out as especially
distinctive of Professor Longfellow’s MS. it is remarkably
deficient; and, in fact, the literary character
of no two individuals could be more radically different.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i068.jpg' alt='Signature of W. E. Channing' id='iid-0036' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Reverend <span class='sc'>W. E. Channing</span> is at the head of
our moral and didactic writers. His reputation both
at home and abroad is deservedly high, and in regard
to the matters of purity, polish and modulation of
style, he may be said to have attained the dignity of
a standard and a classic. He has, it is true, been severely
criticised, even in respect to these very points,
by the Edinburg Review. The critic, however, made
out his case but lamely, and proved nothing beyond
his own incompetence. To detect occasional, or even
frequent inadvertences in the way of bad grammar,
faulty construction, or mis-usage of language, is not
to prove impurity of <span class='it'>style</span>—a word which happily
has a bolder signification than any dreamed of by the
Zoilus of the Review in question. Style regards,
more than anything else, the <span class='it'>tone</span> of a composition.
All the rest is not unimportant, to be sure, but appertains
to the minor morals of literature, and can be
learned by rote by the meanest simpletons in letters—can
be carried to its highest excellence by dolts
who, upon the whole, are despicable as stylists. Irving’s
style is inimitable in its grace and delicacy;
yet few of our practised writers are guilty of more
frequent inadvertences of language. In what may be
termed his mere English, he is surpassed by fifty
whom we could name. Mr. Tuckerman’s English on
the contrary is sufficiently pure, but a more lamentable
style than that of his “Sicily” it would be difficult
to point out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Besides those peculiarities which we have already
mentioned as belonging to Dr. Channing’s style, we
must not fail to mention a certain calm, broad deliberateness
which constitutes <span class='it'>force</span> in its highest
character, and approaches to majesty. All these
traits will be found to exist plainly in his chirography,
the character of which is exemplified by the
signature, although this is somewhat larger than the
general manuscript.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i070a.jpg' alt='Signature of L. A. Wilmer.' id='iid-0037' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Wilmer</span> has written and published much; but
he has reaped the usual fruits of a spirit of independence,
and has thus failed to make that impression on
the <span class='it'>popular</span> mind which his talents, under other circumstances,
would have effected. But better days
are in store for him, and for all who “hold to the
right way,” despising the yelpings of the small dogs
of our literature. His prose writings have all merit—always
the merit of a chastened style. But he is
more favorably known by his poetry, in which the
student of the British classics will find much for
warm admiration. We have few better versifiers
than Mr. Wilmer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His chirography plainly indicates the cautious
polish and terseness of his style, but the signature
does not convey the print-like appearance of the MS.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i070b.jpg' alt='Signature of J.E.Dow' id='iid-0038' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Dow</span> is distinguished as the author of many
fine sea-pieces, among which will be remembered a
series of papers called “The Log of Old Ironsides.”
His land sketches are not generally so good. He has
a fine imagination, which as yet is undisciplined, and
leads him into occasional bombast. As a poet he
has done better things than as a writer of prose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His MS., which has been strongly modified by circumstances,
gives no indication of his true character,
literary or moral.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i071a.jpg' alt='Signature of H Hastings Weld' id='iid-0039' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Weld</span> is well known as the present working
editor of the New York “Tattler” and “Brother
Jonathan.” His attention was accidentally directed
to literature about ten years ago, after a minority, to
use his own words, “spent at sea, in a store, in a machine
shop, and in a printing office.” He is now, we
believe, about thirty-one years of age. His deficiency
of what is termed regular education would scarcely
be gleaned from his editorials, which, in general,
are unusually well written. His “Corrected Proofs”
is a work which does him high credit, and which has
been extensively circulated, although “printed at
odd times by himself, when he had nothing else to
do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His MS. resembles that of Mr. Joseph C. Neal in
many respects, but is less open and less legible. His
signature is altogether much better than his general
chirography.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. <span class='sc'>McMakin</span> is one of the editors of the “Philadelphia
Saturday Courier,” and has given to the
world several excellent specimens of his poetical
ability. His MS. is clear and graceful; the signature
affording a very good idea of it. The general hand,
in fact, is fully as good.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. <span class='sc'>M. St. Leon Loud</span> is one of the finest poets
of this country; possessing, we think, more of the
true divine <span class='it'>afflatus</span> than any of her female contemporaries.
She has, in especial, <span class='it'>imagination</span> of no common
order, and unlike many of her sex whom we

<p class='pindent'>While she <span class='it'>can</span>, upon occasion, compose the ordinary
metrical sing-song with all the decorous proprieties
which are in fashion, she yet ventures very frequently
into a more ethereal region. We refer our readers
to a truly beautiful little poem entitled the “Dream
of the Lonely Isle,” and lately published in this
Magazine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Loud’s MS. is exceedingly clear, neat and

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. <span class='sc'>Pliny Earle</span>, of Frankford, Pa., has not only
distinguished himself by several works of medical and
general science, but has become well known to the
literary world, of late, by a volume of very fine
poems, the longest, but by no means the best, of
which, was entitled “Marathon.” This latter is
not greatly inferior to the “Marco Bozzaris” of Halleck;
while some of the minor pieces equal any
American poems.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His chirography is peculiarly
neat and beautiful, giving indication of the elaborate
finish which characterises his compositions. The
signature conveys the general hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. <span class='sc'>John C. McCabe</span>, of Richmond, Virginia, has
written much and generally well, in prose and poetry,
for the periodicals of the day—for the “Southern Literary
Messenger” in especial, and other journals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His MS. is in every respect a bad one—an ordinary
clerk’s hand, meaning nothing. It has been strongly
modified, however, by circumstances which would
scarcely have permitted it to be otherwise than it is.</p>

several of the Southern and Western journals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His chirography resembles that of Mr. Paulding in
being at the same time very <span class='it'>petite</span>, very beautiful,
and very illegible. His MSS., in being equally well

his disposition.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>David Hoffman</span>, Esq., of Baltimore, has not only
contributed much and well to monthly Magazines
and Reviews, but has given to the world several valuable
publications in book form. His style is terse,
pungent and otherwise excellent, although disfigured
by a half comic half serious pedantry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His MS. has about it nothing strongly indicative

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>S. D. Langtree</span>, has been long and favorably
known to the public as editor of the “Georgetown
Metropolitan,” and, more lately, of the “Democratic
Review,” both of which journals he has conducted
with distinguished success. As a critic he has proved
himself just, bold and acute, while his prose compositions
generally, evince the man of talent and taste.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His MS. is not remarkably good, being somewhat
too scratchy and tapering. We include him, of course,
in the editorial category.</p>

<img src='images/i075.jpg' alt='Signature of R.T. Conrad.' id='iid-0047' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Judge <span class='sc'>Conrad</span> occupies, perhaps, the first place
among our Philadelphia <span class='it'>literati</span>. He has distinguished
himself both as a prose writer and a poet—not
to speak of his high legal reputation. He has
been a frequent contributor to the periodicals of this
city, and, we believe, to one at least of the Eastern
Reviews. His first production which attracted general
notice was a tragedy entitled “Conrad, King of
Naples.” It was performed at the Arch Street Theatre,
and elicited applause from the more judicious.
This play was succeeded by “Jack Cade,” performed
at the Walnut Street Theatre, and lately
modified and reproduced under the title of “Aylmere.”
In its new dress, this drama has been one
of the most successful ever written by an American,
not only attracting crowded houses, but extorting the
good word of our best critics. In occasional poetry
Judge Conrad has also done well. His lines “On a
Blind Boy Soliciting Charity” have been highly admired,
and many of his other pieces evince ability of
a high order. His political fame is scarcely a topic
for these pages, and is, moreover, too much a matter
of common observation to need comment from us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His MS. is neat, legible, and forcible, evincing
combined caution and spirit in a very remarkable
degree.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The chirography of Ex-President <span class='sc'>Adams</span> (whose
poem, “The Wants of Man,” has, of late, attracted
so much attention,) is remarkable for a certain steadiness
of purpose pervading the whole, and overcoming
even the constitutional tremulousness of the
writer’s hand. Wavering in every letter, the entire
MS. has yet a firm, regular, and decisive appearance.
It is also very legible.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>P. P. Cooke</span>, Esq., of Winchester, Va., is well
known, especially in the South, as the author of numerous
excellent contributions to the “Southern
Literary Messenger.” He has written some of the
finest poetry of which America can boast. A little
piece of his, entitled “Florence Vane,” and contributed
to the “Gentleman’s Magazine” of this
city, during our editorship of that journal, was remarkable
for the high ideality it evinced, and for the
great delicacy and melody of its rhythm. It was
universally admired and copied, as well here as in
England. We saw it not long ago, <span class='it'>as original</span>, in
“Bentley’s Miscellany.” Mr. Cooke has, we believe,
nearly ready for press, a novel called “Maurice Werterbern,”
whose success we predict with confidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His MS. is clear, forcible, and legible, but disfigured
by some little of that affectation which is scarcely a
blemish in his literary style.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i077a.jpg' alt='Signature of T R Dew.' id='iid-0050' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Prof. <span class='sc'>Thomas R. Dew</span>, of William and Mary College
in Virginia, was one of the able contributors who
aided to establish the “Southern Literary Messenger”
in the days of its <span class='it'>débût</span>. His MS. is precisely in
keeping with his literary character. Both are heavy,
massive, unornamented and <span class='it'>diffuse</span> in the extreme.
His epistles seemed to have been scrawled with the
stump of a quill dipped in very thick ink, and one or
two words extend sometimes throughout a line. The
signature is more compact than the general MS.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i077b.jpg' alt='Signature of J. Beauchamp Jones' id='iid-0051' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. <span class='sc'>J. Beauchamp Jones</span> has been, we believe,
connected for many years past with the lighter literature
of Baltimore, and at present edits the “Baltimore
Saturday Visiter,” with much judgment and
general ability. He is the author of a series of papers
of high merit now in course of publication in
the “Visiter,” and entitled “Wild Western Scenes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His MS. is distinct, and might be termed a fine one;
but is somewhat too much in consonance with the
ordinary clerk style to be either graceful or forcible.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i078a.jpg' alt='Signature of Chas. J. Peterson' id='iid-0052' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Charles J. Peterson</span> has for a long time
been connected with the periodical literature of Philadelphia,
as one of the editors of “Graham’s Magazine”
and of “The Saturday Evening Post.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His MS., when unhurried, is a very good one—clear,
weighty, and picturesque; but when carelessly written
is nearly illegible, on account of a too slight
variation of form in the short letters.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i078b.jpg' alt='Signature of W E Burton' id='iid-0053' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Burton</span> is better known as a comedian than as
a literary man; but he has written many short prose
articles of merit, and his quondam editorship of the
“Gentleman’s Magazine” would, at all events, entitle
him to a place in this collection. He has, moreover,
published one or two books. An annual issued
by Carey and Hart in 1840, consisted entirely of prose
contributions from himself, with poetical ones from
Charles West Thompson, Esq. In this work many
of the tales were good.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Burton’s MS. is scratchy and petite, betokening
indecision and care or caution. The whole
chirography resembles that of Mr. Tasistro very
nearly.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i079.jpg' alt='Signature of Richard Henry Wilde' id='iid-0054' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Richard Henry Wilde</span>, Esq., of Georgia, has acquired
much reputation as a poet, and especially as
the author of a little piece entitled “My Life is like
the Summer Rose,” whose claim to originality has
been made the subject of repeated and reiterated attack
and defence. Upon the whole it is hardly worth
quarrelling about. Far better verses are to be found
in every second newspaper we take up. Mr. Wilde
has also lately published, or is about to publish, a
“Life of Tasso,” for which he has been long collecting
material.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His MS. has all the peculiar sprawling and elaborate
tastelessness of Mr. Palfrey’s, to which altogether
it bears a marked resemblance. The love of
effect, however, is more perceptible in Mr. Wilde’s
than even in Mr. Palfrey’s.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i080.jpg' alt='Signature of G.G. Foster' id='iid-0055' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>G. G. Foster</span>, Esq., has acquired much reputation,
especially in the South and West, by his poetical contributions
to the literature of the day. All his articles
breathe the true spirit. At one period he edited
a weekly paper in Alabama; more lately the “Bulletin”
at St. Louis; and, at present, he conducts the
“Pennant,” in that city, with distinguished ability.
Not long ago he issued the prospectus of a monthly
magazine. Should he succeed in getting the journal
under way, there can be no doubt of his success.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His MS. is remarkably clear and graceful; evincing
a keen sense of the beautiful. It seems, however,
to be somewhat deficient in force; and his letters
are never so well written in their conclusion as
in their commencement. We have before remarked
that this peculiarity in MSS. is a sure indication of
<span class='it'>fatigability</span> of temper. Few men who write thus
are free from a certain vacillation of purpose. The
signature above is rather heavier than that from
which it was copied.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i081a.jpg' alt='Signature of Lew Cass' id='iid-0056' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Lewis Cass</span>, the Ex-Secretary of War, has distinguished
himself as one of the finest <span class='it'>belles lettres</span>
scholars of America. At one period he was a very
regular contributor to the “Southern Literary Messenger,”
and, even lately, he has furnished that journal
with one or two very excellent papers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His MS. is clear, deliberate and statesmanlike;
resembling that of Edward Everett very closely. It
is not often that we see a letter written altogether by
himself. He generally employs an amanuensis,
whose chirography does not differ materially from
his own, but is somewhat more regular.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i081b.jpg' alt='Signature of James Brooks' id='iid-0057' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>James Brooks</span>, Esq., enjoys rather a private than
a public literary reputation; but his talents are unquestionably
great, and his productions have been
numerous and excellent. As the author of many of
the celebrated Jack Downing letters, and as the reputed
author of the whole of them, he would at all
events be entitled to a place among our <span class='it'>literati</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His chirography is simple, clear and legible, with
little grace and less boldness. These traits are precisely
those of his literary style.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i081c.jpg' alt='Signature of Jack Downing' id='iid-0058' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>As the authorship of the Jack Downing letters is
even still considered by many a moot point, (although
in fact there should be no question about it,)
and as we have already given the signature of Mr.
Seba Smith, and (just above) of Mr. Brooks, we now
present our readers with a fac-simile signature of
the “<span class='it'>veritable Jack</span>” himself, written by him individually
in our own bodily presence. Here, then, is
an opportunity of comparison.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chirography of “the veritable Jack” is a very
good, honest, sensible hand, and not very dissimilar
to that of Ex-President Adams.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i082.jpg' alt='Signature of J. R. Lowell.' id='iid-0059' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. <span class='sc'>J. R. Lowell</span>, of Massachusetts, is entitled,
in our opinion, to at least the second or third place
among the poets of America. We say this on account
of the vigor of his <span class='it'>imagination</span>—a faculty to
be first considered in all criticism upon poetry. In
this respect he surpasses, we think, any of our writers
(at least any of those who have put themselves prominently
forth as poets) with the exception of Longfellow,
and perhaps one other. His ear for rhythm,
nevertheless, is imperfect, and he is very far from
possessing the artistic ability of either Longfellow,
Bryant, Halleck, Sprague or Pierpont. The reader
desirous of properly estimating the powers of Mr.
Lowell will find a very beautiful little poem from his
pen in the October number of this Magazine. There
is one also (not quite so fine) in the number for last
month. He will contribute regularly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His MS. is strongly indicative of the vigor and precision
of his poetical thought. The man who writes
thus, for example, will never be guilty of metaphorical
extravagance, and there will be found <span class='it'>terseness</span> as
well as strength in all that he does.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i083a.jpg' alt='Signature of L. J. Cist.' id='iid-0060' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. <span class='sc'>L. J. Cist</span>, of Cincinnati, has not written much
prose, and is known especially by his poetical compositions,
many of which have been very popular,
although they are at times disfigured by false metaphor,
and by a meretricious straining after effect. This
latter foible makes itself clearly apparent in his chirography,
which abounds in ornamental flourishes,
not illy executed, to be sure, but in very bad taste.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i083b.jpg' alt='Signature of T S Arthur' id='iid-0061' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Arthur</span> is not without a rich talent for
description of scenes in low life, but is uneducated,
and too fond of mere vulgarities to please a refined
taste. He has published “The Subordinate”, and
“Insubordination”, two tales distinguished by the
peculiarities above mentioned. He has also written
much for our weekly papers, and the “Lady’s Book.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His hand is a common-place clerk’s hand, such as
we might expect him to write. The signature is
much better than the general MS.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i083c.jpg' alt='Signature of Jms E. Heath' id='iid-0062' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Heath</span> is almost the only person of any literary
distinction residing in the chief city of the Old
Dominion. He edited the “Southern Literary Messenger”
in the five or six first months of its existence;
and, since the secession of the writer of this article,
has frequently aided in its editorial conduct.
He is the author of “Edge-Hill”, a well-written
novel, which, owing to the circumstances of its publication,
did not meet with the reception it deserved.
His writings are rather polished and graceful, than
forcible or original; and these peculiarities can be
traced in his chirography.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i084.jpg' alt='Signature of Thos H. Chivers' id='iid-0063' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. <span class='sc'>Thomas Holley Chivers</span>, of New York, is at
the same time one of the best and one of the worst
poets in America. His productions affect one as a
wild dream—strange, incongruous, full of images of
more than arabesque monstrosity, and snatches of
sweet unsustained song. Even his worst nonsense
(and some of it is horrible) has an indefinite charm
of sentiment and melody. We can never be sure that
there is <span class='it'>any</span> meaning in his words—neither is there
any meaning in many of our finest musical airs—but
the effect is very similar in both. His figures of
speech are metaphor run mad, and his grammar is
often none at all. Yet there are as fine individual
passages to be found in the poems of Dr. Chivers, as
in those of any poet whatsoever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His MS. resembles that of P. P. Cooke very nearly,
and in poetical character the two gentlemen are
closely akin. Mr. Cooke is, by much, the more <span class='it'>correct</span>;
while Dr. Chivers is sometimes the more poetic.
Mr. C. always sustains himself; Dr. C. never.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i085a.jpg' alt='Signature of Joseph Story' id='iid-0064' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Judge <span class='sc'>Story</span>, and his various literary and political
labors, are too well know to require comment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His chirography is a noble one—bold, clear, massive,
and deliberate, betokening in the most unequivocal
manner all the characteristics of his intellect.
The plain unornamented style of his compositions is
impressed with accuracy upon his hand-writing, the
whole air of which is well conveyed in the signature.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i085b.jpg' alt='Signature of J. Frost' id='iid-0065' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>John Frost</span>, Esq., Professor of Belles Lettres in
the High School of Philadelphia, and at present editor
of “The Young People’s Book,” has distinguished
himself by numerous literary compositions
for the periodicals of the day, and by a great number
of published works which come under the head of
the <span class='it'>utile</span> rather than of the <span class='it'>dulce</span>—at least in the
estimation of the young. He is a gentleman of fine
taste, sound scholarship, and great general ability.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His chirography denotes his mental idiosyncrasy
with great precision. Its careful neatness, legibility
and finish, are but a part of that turn of mind which
leads him so frequently into compilation. The signature
here given is more diminutive than usual.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i086a.jpg' alt='Signature of James F. Otis.' id='iid-0066' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. <span class='sc'>J. F. Otis</span> is well known as a writer for the
Magazines; and has, at various times, been connected
with many of the leading newspapers of the day—especially
with those in New York and Washington.
His prose and poetry are equally good; but he writes
too much and too hurriedly to write invariably well.
His taste is fine, and his judgment in literary matters
is to be depended upon at all times when not interfered
with by his personal antipathies or predilections.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His chirography is exceedingly illegible and, like
his style, has every possible fault except that of the
common-place.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i086b.jpg' alt='Signature of J. N. Reynolds' id='iid-0067' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Reynolds</span> occupied at one time a distinguished
position in the eye of the public, on account of his
great and laudable exertions to get up the American
South Polar expedition, from a personal participation
in which he was most shamefully excluded. He has
written much and well. Among other works, the
public are indebted to him for a graphic account of the
noted voyage of the frigate Potomac to Madagascar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His MS. is an ordinary clerk’s hand, giving no indication
of character.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i087a.jpg' alt='Signature of William Cutter' id='iid-0068' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. <span class='sc'>William Cutter</span>, a young merchant of Portland,
Maine, although not very generally known as a
poet beyond his immediate neighborhood, (or at least
out of the Eastern States) has given to the world numerous
compositions which prove him to be possessed
of the true fire. He is, moreover, a fine scholar, and
a prose writer of distinguished merit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His chirography is very similar to that of Count
Tasistro, and the two gentlemen resemble each other
very peculiarly in their literary character.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i087b.jpg' alt='Signature of David Paul Brown' id='iid-0069' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>David Paul Brown</span>, Esq., is scarcely more distinguished
in his legal capacity than by his literary
compositions. As a dramatic writer he has met with
much success. His “Sertorius” has been particularly
well received both upon the stage and in the
closet. His fugitive productions, both in prose and
verse, have also been numerous, diversified, and
excellent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His chirography has no doubt been strongly modified
by the circumstances of his position. No one
can expect a lawyer in full practice to give in his
MS. any true indication of his intellect or character.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i088a.jpg' alt='Signature of E. C. Stedman' id='iid-0070' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Mrs. E. Clementine Stedman</span> has lately attracted
much attention by the delicacy and grace of her
poetical compositions, as well as by the piquancy
and spirit of her prose. For some months past we
have been proud to rank her among the best of the
contributors to “Graham’s Magazine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her chirography differs as materially from that of
her sex in general as does her literary manner from
the usual namby-pamby of our blue-stockings. It is,
indeed, a beautiful MS., very closely resembling that
of Professor Longfellow, but somewhat more diminutive,
and far more full of grace.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i088b.jpg' alt='Signature of John G Whittier' id='iid-0071' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>J. Greenleaf Whittier</span>, is placed by his particular
admirers in the very front rank of American poets.
We are not disposed, however, to agree with their
decision in every respect. Mr. Whittier is a fine
versifier, so far as strength is regarded independently
of modulation. His subjects, too, are usually chosen
with the view of affording scope to a certain
<span class='it'>vivida vis</span> of expression which seems to be his forte;
but in taste, and especially in <span class='it'>imagination</span>, which
Coleridge has justly styled the <span class='it'>soul</span> of all poetry, he
is even remarkably deficient. His themes are <span class='it'>never</span>
to our liking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His chirography is an ordinary clerk’s hand, affording
little indication of character.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i089.jpg' alt='Signature of Ann S Stephens' id='iid-0072' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. <span class='sc'>Ann S. Stephens</span> was at one period the editor
of the “Portland Magazine,” a periodical of which
we have not heard for some time, and which, we
presume, has been discontinued. More lately her
name has been placed upon the title page of “The
Lady’s Companion” of New York, as one of the conductors
of that journal—to which she has contributed
many articles of merit and popularity. She has also
written much and well, for various other periodicals,
and will, hereafter, enrich this magazine with her
compositions, and act as one of its editors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her MS. is a very excellent one, and differs from
that of her sex in general, by an air of more than
usual force and freedom.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='sc'>Book II.</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Being</span> now somewhat advanced in life, I can look
back on the past with that degree of calmness and
self-complacency so delightful to age. I cannot think,
with Miss Landon, that a person regards the follies
of his youth with more severity himself than others
regard them. Indeed I feel disposed to believe that
those very follies form the chief charm of our early
days; and, as for myself, I can hardly regret that I
was not born a Nestor. So much by way of preface
to my Second Book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reader who has been kind enough to follow me
thus far in the history of my youth, will recollect
that I introduced him to a social circle at Mrs. Melville’s,
one evening in the early part of summer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Martagon, the gentleman with the large shoulders,
was seated in an arm-chair, admirably adapted
to his proportions. Mr. Pratt was looking unutterable
things at Miss Azile, who, on the present occasion,
was exceedingly unmerciful on love-stricken
swains. Miss Emily Melville was warbling a soft
enchanting air, which she accompanied with the
guitar; and Mr. Desmond was wrapt in pleasing
thoughts, the consequence thereof. Mr. Martagon
being an ancient admirer of Miss Virginia Melville,
enlisted her attention by a very judicious discourse
on the evils of matrimony; which, of course, induced
me to be very busily engaged at nothing particular.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the music had ceased, the conversation gradually
became general. Poetry was discussed—fiction
voted a great evil—superstition allowed to be a
universal failing—and Sir Walter Scott pronounced
the king of ghost-makers; which latter allusion led
to a very edifying description of the person and character
of a certain ghost seen by each individual present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Martagon, who had seen an unusual and pleasing
variety of ghosts, recollected an uncommonly
peculiar one which appeared to him during a twilight
ramble in the woods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This reminded Mr. Pratt of an extraordinary vision
which he had once witnessed in the form of a hog;
which prompted Mr. Desmond to relate an amusing
anecdote of his experience in things supernatural.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Various ghost-stories were related by the company,
till, by one of those unaccountable changes which so
frequently occur in a lively circle, the conversation
turned to love and courtship. This was a subject
upon which I was very sensitive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Azile, the satirical young lady, was of opinion
that all such things are highly ridiculous, and much
to be regretted; in which opinion the fair portion of
the company generally coincided. The reader who
has read the anecdote of the Persian over whose
head a sword was suspended by a thread, can imagine
my anxiety to ascertain the opinion of the person in
whom I was most interested. I did not long remain
in suspense—“She considered it unnatural and improper
for a young lady to love;” which assertion
was accompanied by a very significant look at myself.
The philosophy of indifference had ever been
my most difficult study. I could not persuade myself
that I was prepared for disappointment; and, in
fact, my hopes were too sanguine to allow for many
thoughts of a gloomy character. All was over now,
however; and as I hurried away as miserable as
Jacques, I thought there was a very pretty end to my
day-dreams and night-visions. Byron’s reproach
occurred to me with all its bitterness—</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus ended my first misfortunes, which, being the
most serious, I have dwelt upon at some length. I
now turn with a lighter heart to my subsequent career.
To avoid all such affairs in future, I resolved
to visit Texas, where, I was informed, women were
uncommonly scarce. This great inducement balanced
all the disadvantages of climate and warfare. I
never wished to look upon a bright eye or a dimpled
cheek again. Texas, therefore, was my destination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few months calmed the turbulence of my mind;
and I believed I was now forever qualified to withstand
the charms of woman, and exempt from the
troubles of the heart. Experience had taught me
that everything is not gold which glitters. I had
also learned to doubt the lauded constancy of the
opposite sex, in that tender passion to which I was
so susceptible. Indeed I had good reason to believe
that caprice and fickleness of heart were their ruling
traits; and I fully determined to avoid, in future,
building my hopes of happiness on such baseless
foundations. So far I acted with prudence; and I
felt very well satisfied with my embryo philosophy.
During my tour, however, an incident occurred that
greatly altered my opinions on this subject. It effected
a wonderful change, too, in my estimation of
woman’s constancy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had stopped to spend a few days in the city of
T——. There was nothing about this place, but
its picturesque situation, worthy of a traveller’s attention.
I soon became satiated with the beauties of
the surrounding scenery; and as the accommodations
of the hotel were very limited, I determined to pursue
my journey by the first means of conveyance. To
my chagrin I learned that several days would elapse
before I could find a stage for my place of destination.
What to do with myself in the meantime, I
could scarcely divine. Society had lost its charm;
public amusements had become nauseous and uninteresting;
and I was heartily tired of rambling about,
without a congenial friend to commune with, or admire
what I admired. In this dilemma I chanced
to find, on ransacking my apartment, a neatly bound
novel—the “Pilgrims of the Rhine.” I had read
this beautiful romance, with great delight, some years
previously; but I discovered, on opening the present
volume, that there were criticisms and observations
on the margin, which offered some room for studying
the mind and character of one of its readers; and I
was induced to peruse it again. The pencilings
were in the delicate hand of a female. Passages,
which, for their beauty of diction and refined sentiment,
I recollected having greatly admired, were
carefully marked; and in many instances they elicited
acute observations, and eloquent eulogies from the
fair reader. As I progressed, I became as much interested
in these comments, as I had formerly been
in the work itself. They evinced at once a highly
cultivated imagination—a depth and tenderness of
feeling—and a visionary turn of mind, extremely
captivating to a young reader. That sympathy,
which the author of Hyperion so eloquently remarks
is requisite for the appreciation of genius, seemed
characteristic of the fair unknown. The gradual
development of her history, as gleaned from these
scattered thoughts and opinions, and the general
tenor of her mind, interested me far more than I was
disposed to admit, even to myself. That I may not
be deemed unnaturally visionary, or sentimental, I
shall quote a few passages, which, though taken at
random, may serve to show the source from which I
drew my deductions. The delicate hand of the commentator
had slightly touched the following:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Her youth was filled with hope, and many colored
dreams; she loved, and the hues of morning slept
upon the yet disenchanted earth. The heavens to
her were not as the common sky; the wave had its
peculiar music to her ear, and the rustling leaves a
pleasantness that none, whose heart is not bathed in
the love and sense of beauty, could discern.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the remarks that were attached to this, I
pictured the sympathising reader, who so feelingly
dwelt upon it, as one, beautiful like Gertrude, and
constituted to love with the same fervency and devotion.
She was evidently young—her thoughts were
tender—her sentiments lively and refined. That
she was beautiful, my fancy did not permit me to
doubt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next passage left rather a disagreeable impression:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I look upon the world, and see all that is fair and
good; I look upon <span class='it'>you</span>, and see all that I can venerate
and adore.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She doubtless intended this quotation for one she
loved. I began to experience all the pangs of jealousy;
for well convinced that she was beautiful,
young, and gifted, I did not conceive it improbable
that I might have a rival, whose precedence in her
affections could not but materially affect my chances
of success, should I ever be fortunate enough to find
her. As soon as I became sufficiently calm, I pursued
my task. The concluding pages were evidently
stained with tears. This greatly excited my curiosity;
but I fancied her grief was attributable to the
recollection of some misfortune conjured up by an
allusion to the grave:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The chords of thought, vibrating to the subtlest
emotions, may be changed by a single incident, or in
a single hour; a sound of sacred music, a green and
quiet burial place, may convert the form of death
into the aspect of an angel. And, therefore, wisely,
and with a beautiful love, did the Greeks strip the
grave of its unreal gloom; wisely did they body forth
the great principle of rest, and by solemn and lovely
images—unconscious of the northern madness that
made a spectre of repose!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here was all I could require. Her lover had died
in all the promise of genius and beauty. His death
was simply and solemnly commemorated by a quiet
burial in some sylvan solitude. The allusion, in the
passage quoted, had revived all the poignancy of his
loss, and her tears were evidences of the purity and
sincerity of her affection. Although there now appeared
no rival to fear, I was aware that love survives
death; but as I never had much confidence in woman’s
constancy, this did not alarm me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Forgetting my past experience and my vows of
celibacy, I devoted myself immediately to this new
chimera. On the title page of the book, which had
caused such wild fantasies, I perceived the initials—“E.
S. C——.” On examining the page more minutely,
I found written in various places, “Emma,” which
I knew must be the name for one of the initials. All
further search proved vain; and I resolved to examine
the “traveller’s register” in hope of procuring more
exact information. About a month back, were written
in a bold, free hand, the names of Col. Robert St.
Clair and Sister—at least the surname of Miss St.
Clair, and the name in full of her military brother.
My next care was to find out their destination. With
surprise and gratification, I perceived that it was
precisely where I was journeying myself. My plan
for an introduction was quickly made up. I would
call on Miss St. Clair and restore her the lost book.
My remarks on her criticisms would of course be
flattering; and she could not avoid entering into a
conversation. Common politeness would induce her
to ask me to call again. Thus clear seemed the road
to happiness! Let me now pursue it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing of interest occurred on my journey to
P——. Immediately after my arrival I made inquiries
for Colonel St. Clair. There was little difficulty
in finding his residence. The purport of my
mission induced me to devote more than usual care
to my toilet; and as I knocked at the polished and
brass-mounted door of Colonel St. Clair’s house, the
reflection therefrom satisfied me that I was a very
passable personage. I was ushered into the drawing-room.
“The Colonel was not at home; but the white
lady would be down directly”—so the servant informed
me, grinning admiration from ear to ear.
Who the “white lady” was, I could not imagine;
but her appearance dissipated all suspicion that it
might be Miss St. Clair herself. She was apparently
a lady of forty, much worn and faded by the cares of
life. Her countenance was emaciated and melancholy;
but her eyes were still bright and expressive;
and her features were not uninteresting. She
might once have been beautiful. Her form, though
somewhat ghastly, was still symmetrical; and her
quiet address and dignified manners proved that she
had moved in the best society. After a few preliminary
remarks, I entered on the subject which was
nearest my heart:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will pardon my curiosity, madam, when I
tell you I have a particular reason for inquiring if
there is a young lady in this house, who is very fond
of reading? I am uncertain about her name, but I
shall give you a brief description, which will enable
you to judge whether I am right in my conjectures
respecting her identity. She is, I presume, about
eighteen; and in rather a delicate state of health, I
should imagine, though I will not be certain as to
that. She has lately lost a friend, dearer to her than
life, and I am led to believe his death occasions her
the most poignant grief. I will not say she was
betrothed to him. It is not, however, improbable
that she was. I have no very exact recollection of
her features; but I can give you an idea of her mental
traits. She is highly imaginative; and takes great
delight in elegant works of fiction. Her taste is remarkably
good; and I believe she has written a great
deal—probably contributed to the periodicals of the
day. On so slight an acquaintance, madam, I feel a
delicacy in declaring my motives for the minuteness
of my inquiries; but you cannot avoid perceiving
that I feel singularly interested in the history and
identity of the young lady to whom I allude.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really, sir,” she replied, with a lurking smile,
“I can scarcely divine what you are seeking for.
However, I am only sorry you have mistaken the
place. There is no young lady here, such as you
describe. In fact I am the only female belonging
to the house; and I can hardly conceive how you
were misled.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then,” I observed with a fallen countenance,
“<span class='it'>you</span> are Miss Emma St. Clair?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is my name, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was evident, now, that I had been laboring under
a very serious mistake. My situation was really
embarrassing. It was not at all unlikely that the
elderly spinster would consider me out of my senses,
if I openly avowed the error my imagination had
caused me to make. I therefore feigned as creditable
a story as the existing circumstances would permit;
and in conclusion, asked Miss St. Clair if she had lost
a volume containing Bulwer’s romance of the Rhine,
during her sojourn at T——?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe,” she replied, blushing slightly, “my
carelessness caused me to mislay a copy of that
work. I regret the loss, not for its value, but simply
because there were some pencillings in it which I did
not wish to be perused.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I then produced the book, and confessed having
read it and the comments with great delight. This
led to a general discussion on the subject of fictitious
literature, in which I discovered Miss St. Clair was
deeply versed; nor did the discernment and susceptibility
evinced in her random pencillings, mislead me
as to the character of her mind. The result of my
visit was an invitation to call again. I did not neglect
the opportunity thus afforded, of cultivating the acquaintance
of the accomplished spinster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In due time I learned many circumstances of her
early history. At the age of eighteen, she had
plighted her faith to a young officer in the navy.
Before arrangements could be effected for their marriage,
he was compelled to depart on an expedition to
the South Seas. For nearly two years, Emma St.
Clair received occasional letters—all evincing unchangeable
love in her betrothed. After this period
he ceased to correspond. The agony of separation
was enhanced by doubts as to his fate. In a state
of mind bordering on distraction, she passed many a
weary year. Time at length soothed her sorrow;
but her love was the true—unchangeable love of
woman, and the wounds of a bleeding heart were
never closed. Various offers of marriage were rejected—she
could never love again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This affecting little sketch brought tears to the
eyes of the narrator. She proved to me, in her melancholy
history, that the female heart is not fickle
when it truly loves, and that the constancy of woman
“passeth all understanding.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No alternative was now left me, but to continue
my travels. Having taken a place in the stage for
W——, I set out on my journey, consoling myself
with the reflection that I was destined to be miserable
all the days of my life. My attention, however,
was diverted from this gloomy presentiment, by a
young lady of seventeen, who was returning from a
boarding-school in the city, to her parental domicil
at W——, and who unfortunately chanced to be the
only passenger beside myself. Taking the liberty of
a fellow traveller, I addressed her with becoming
gallantry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are travelling to W——?” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir,” she blushingly replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you ever been there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—my parents reside in W——.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed!—you have been on a visit, then, to
P——?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No sir—I have been to school; and I am going
home to spend the vacation. Pa would have come
for me, but he could not spare time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” said I, “you will not be unprotected. Fortunately
I am going to W—— myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Pa says I mustn’t talk to strangers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, your Pa is—an old gentleman! My name
is Weston—Harry Weston, so I hope I am no longer
a stranger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed—I don’t know sir; I never heard of you
before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was very candid, and very discreet. I remained
silent; and my fair companion seemed to be
deeply engaged in perusing a little work which she
drew from her reticule.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What may that be?” I at length ventured to inquire,
although I was pretty well convinced it was
the ‘Young lady’s Amaranth,’ or a Pocket Lacon,
containing ‘Good Advice in small Parcels.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This book, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A hymn-book, I think—that is, it <span class='it'>is</span> a hymn-book,
which Mrs. Wriggleton told me to read on the
way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Wriggleton is a very accomplished lady,” I
observed. By the by, I had never heard of her before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know her then!” cried my fair young traveller.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—I am slightly acquainted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,—I <span class='it'>think</span> I heard her mention your
name!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very probably. Yours is Miss Fanny Cullobe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Mine is Corinna Wilton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the reader may presume, I had never heard of
either names; nevertheless, I did not like to appear
ignorant. In Miss Corinna, I discovered a transient
acquaintance, to whom I had been introduced at a
ball; which reminded Miss Corinna that she had an
indistinct recollection of my features. Not aware
that I had made a vow to remain invincible forever
more, she laid siege to my heart during the greater
part of the journey. We soon became quite familiar.
I perceived that my fair acquaintance was quite
sprightly and talkative; and did not venture to remind
her of her Pa’s injunction. Eventually she
handed me her hymn-book, with the following passage
marked for my perusal:—</p>

<p class='noindent'>Fancying this was a piece of premeditated coquetry,
I laughed, and acknowledged the compliment. My
Dulcinea, however, encouraged by the reception of
her first advance, next pointed out, with an almost
irresistible smile, the verse commencing—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>

<div class='stanza-outer'>

<p class='line0'>Shall lead my captive soul astray;”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>which somewhat alarmed me; but I read on—</p>

<p class='line0'>And know no other will but thine.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>Not a little astonished, I looked up in the countenance
of the besieger. She was pretty, and sprightly
too; but now all mirth had fled, and I fancied a
bright tear glittered in her eye. At all events she
seemed a good deal agitated. I scarcely knew what
to say. I was becoming incredibly nervous. At this
moment, fate for once befriended me. We were in
W——. The stage had stopped; and I stepped out
to aid Corinna in a similar process. As I took her
hand, I perceived that she trembled. The spirit of
mischief induced me to ask her how she had enjoyed
her journey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She answered—“I shall never forget it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” I very innocently asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was an embarrassing pause. She looked at
me, and sighed, and I repeated the question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can I forget it,” she replied, “when it has
caused me to meet one whom I shall never forget?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This alarmed me considerably; but I could only
look sentimental, and give her a parting squeeze.
Before our final farewell, however, she gave me an
invitation to pay her a visit, which I had not the firmness
to resist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During my rambles round the village for the next
few days, I learned that the Wiltons were a highly
respectable family of great wealth, and that Corinna
was an heiress, who had never made her appearance
in the matrimonial market. Though I had not the
least intention of taking advantage of my conquest,
I considered myself bound in common politeness, to
pay her the promised visit. After some little attention
to my toilet, I set out for the residence of Mr.
Wilton. This personage had formerly been an officer
in the Navy; and I was not surprised to find that he
was precisely such a bluff, hale-looking old gentleman,
as my fancy led me to picture him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir,” said he, when Corinna had formally introduced
me, “I consider you a great young rascal!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thunderstruck at such a reception, I answered—“May
I ask, what induces you to form such an opinion
of me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Damme!” cried the old gentleman, “but you <span class='it'>are</span>
an impudent dog! Haven’t you stolen my daughter’s
heart, without leave or license? But I forgive you,
sir, for I was just such a young scoundrel at your
age. Didn’t I run away with your mother, Corinna,
before I was eighteen? Ah,” continued the ex-officer,
“that was a rare adventure! It was, you
scapegrace!—what are you gaping at?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing,” I replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are an impudent dog, as I said before; but
I’ll be square with you. Corinna, you say he is of
good family, and all that sort of flummery?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Pa!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t <span class='it'>Pa</span> me!—you are dead in love with him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed, Papa—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush! you hussey—don’t I know human nature?
See here, younker, you can take her; and it’s
a d—d sight too good a bargain for you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really, sir,” I stammered, “she mistook my attentions.
My sentiments are entirely—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sentiments, fudge!—none of this palaver! You
want to make me believe you’re the pink of modesty;
but I’ve studied human nature. Here she is with a
fortune you’ll not find every day, and I know you
love her—so no more of your sentimental nonsense,
but prepare to get spliced to-morrow. I go in for doing
things off-hand, as the skipper of the Long-Tom
used to say, when—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear, sir,” I interrupted; “this is altogether
a misunderstanding. It is utterly impossible for me
to marry your daughter!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See here!” cried the venerable gentleman, in a
great rage—“I told you before that I wanted no
more fandangling. Be off, sir! and let me see that
your rigging be in order, by to-morrow!—I’ve
studied human nature, sir!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the little experience I had in that line myself,
I perceived that argument or remonstrance
would not avail; so I bowed myself very politely
out, resolved to leave W——, as soon as possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I could not think, however, of leaving Corinna to
the desolation of unrequited love, without a word of
excuse or consolation. The result of “mature consideration”
on the subject was the following note:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'>B——’s <span class='sc'>Hotel</span>, Tuesday Night,</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>My dear Friend</span>:—Never till now did I really

it appears that I have won your affections—at a
time too, when it is utterly impossible I can requite
them. Your father’s precipitancy prevented an explanation
that might have saved you the mortification
of a written avowal respecting my sentiments; but I
assure you, however desirous I am that you should be
as happy as you desire to be, I cannot love you. The
contemplated union can never be. Truly grateful for
your good opinion of me, and for the honor of the intended
alliance,</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>At four o’clock in the morning, I was in the stage,
on my way to the nearest seaport town. I had made
up my mind to embark for Europe. The packet ship
A—— was ready to start, and awaited only a fair
wind. I engaged a passage for Bordeaux; and the
delay being transient, I was soon beyond the reach
of Captain Wilton, and the wiles of Corinna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But alas! what hope is there for the unfortunate?
I discovered to my sorrow that new troubles awaited
me. As I sat one evening on the bulwark, brooding
over my past career, a female voice of exquisite
pathos, accompanied by the guitar delicately and
tastefully touched, ascended from the ladies’ cabin. I
fancied there was something heavenly in the soft, melancholy
strain that was wafted from the lips of the
songstress. The words were beautiful and touching,
and entirely in unison with my feelings. Under any
circumstances, the performance would not have appeared
commonplace; but at a moment like this,
sounds which alone were the soul and essence of
poetry, borne to my ear so softly, so unexpectedly,
entranced my senses, till I voluntarily exclaimed—</p>

<p class='line0'>Sure something holy lodges in that breast</p>
<p class='line0'>That with these raptures moves the vocal air!”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>Not a breath ruffled the calm, swelling ocean. The
rays of a departing sun gilded every object around
me, with a mellow lustre. A scene of such expanse
and grandeur completed the effect which the music
had wrought upon me; and I was overpowered with
the tenderest emotions. Visions of Home and its
happy associations, came upon me in rapid succession.
But these “thick-coming fantasies” were
verging me towards the melting mood. To hide
my weakness, I entered into a sociable dialogue
with one of my fellow passengers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—a very delightful voice,” he observed in
answer to an observation of mine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is she ill?—I have not seen her at the dining table,”
said I; for I felt more than ordinary interest in
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Delicate, I presume, she prefers the solitude of
her cabin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, yes: her voice indicates a pensive disposition.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just hers, exactly, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you are acquainted with her?” I observed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ought to be,” said my travelling acquaintance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is she young?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—about nineteen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And pretty?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beautiful, <span class='it'>I</span> think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now I really began to imagine I was deeply in
love. This unknown songstress had created strange
sensations in me. I had some thoughts of asking an
introduction; but my acquaintance was almost too
slight with my new friend. After a moment’s
thought, I observed—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should like to know her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you? I shall introduce you, sir, with pleasure,”
was the generous reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In fact,” I whispered, drawing my quondam acquaintance
aside, “to tell you the truth, I am very
much in love with her!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The devil you are!” cried he, with a hearty
laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—I fancy she is a most fascinating woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, you may say that,” replied Mr. Templeton,
whose name I discovered on the corner of his pocket
handkerchief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall we go down now?” said I, for I was very
anxious to see her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just as you please;” and we were soon in the
presence of the fair unknown. She was quite as beautiful
as I expected. Mr. Templeton having learned
my name, presented me with due ceremony—“Mr.
Weston, I’ll introduce you to my wife. Mrs. Templeton,
allow me to introduce to you Mr. Weston.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was thunderstruck! Mr. Templeton enjoyed a
hearty laugh at my confusion; but I was too cruelly
disappointed to join in it. Making the best apology
in my power, I hurried upon deck to conceal my
chagrin. It is needless to add that during the rest of
the voyage I kept aloof from all company—especially
that of the fascinating Mrs. Templeton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall not dwell upon my tour through Europe. I
spent the winter in France; and proceeded thence
through Spain to Italy. Nearly a year was devoted
to this part of my continental ramble. After my
visit to Italy I embarked for England, whence I proceeded
to the highlands of Scotland. I spent an adventurous
season here; and set sail for America.
Three years of my early life thus glided away. On
my journey home, I passed through W——. Captain
Wilton, I learned, had died about a year previously,
of an apoplectic stroke. Corinna had married a
country merchant, a month after my departure. Her
fortune was only nominal; the Captain having deeply
involved himself in debt; but she made amends to
her disappointed spouse by presenting him, a few
months after their marriage, with a fine pair of twins.
So much for the charms of lucre!</p>

<p class='pindent'>My old friend Desmond informed me of various
changes which had taken place during my absence.
I shall only allude to one or two, in which the reader
may feel an interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Martagon, the poet, won the heart of a Southern
lady, rich, accomplished and beautiful. The
natural result was marriage; although, in extenuation,
he wrote a poem, in the style of Ovid, showing
that such a course was necessary at a certain period
of life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Emily Melville became a nun; and enjoyed
thenceforth the quiet charms of a life of peace and
devotion.</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;“——Waking as in sleep,</p>
<p class='line0'>She seemed but now a lovely dream;</p>
<p class='line0'>A star that trembled o’er the deep,</p>
<p class='line0'>Then turned from earth its tender beam.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>My early flame, Miss Virginia Melville, at length
found one whose talents she admired—whose virtues
and personal gifts won her affection. She discovered
that love, with all its follies, is neither unnatural or
improper; and in yielding her hand to the possessor
of her heart, found that the greatest source of happiness,
in this life, is the pure and sacred affection of
two devoted souls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now, kind reader, a word more and we are
done. Impressed with the belief that a faint heart
never would procure me a wife, I managed to get rid
of my timidity as age progressed; and popped the
question at various times. But, alas! some objected
that my hair was getting gray—others that my complexion
was too dark—and one cruel little beauty
told me I looked better as a bachelor, than I would as
a husband. So here I am, verging to a very uncertain
age, with every prospect of a life of single blessedness.
I can only say to those of my fair readers,
who are opposed to bachelorship, that I am not in
fault; and that it is in their power to remedy the evil
by addressing me a word of hope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To all who have found anything amusing or interesting
in these memoirs thus far, I beg leave to remark
that when I am snugly settled, enjoying the
sweets of matrimony, I shall present them with the
third and last book, of the <span class='sc'>Misfortunes of a Timid
Gentleman</span>.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-weight:bold;'>GERMAN LITERATURE, AND A LOVE STORY.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY C. G. FOSTER.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>I perceive</span> with regret that it has of late become
fashionable among the critics and mediocre authors,
on both sides of the water, to decry German literature.
Having rifled the gems—and bright and precious
are they—the casket is now to be kicked aside
as useless lumber. Even Blackwood—so long an
oracle almost of the literary world—even Kit North
himself, than whom a better man or truer poet never
existed—has turned cynic and snarler in his old age,
and after having marched side by side with Scott,
Göethe, Byron, Coleridge, Schiller, Schlegel, and
Shelley, through the brightest era of literature that
has dawned and blazed upon the world since Johnson,
has at last sunk to the level of a literary parvenu,
and laughs at German literature! <span class='it'>He</span> should not
have done it! I tell you, Christopher, that the inspiration
of a century was concentrated in a few
mighty brains, which, within the last century, have
returned to dust. For another hundred years to
come, human intellect will seldom rise above the
mere practical concerns of life—railroads, manufactures,
and machinery. Practical science and natural
philosophy will progress; but not that sublime
and immediate gift of God, the embodying of the
Ideal Perfect. The old world is exhausted. Greece,
and her mouldering monuments of classic beauty—Rome,
and her magnificent mementos of the shadowy
past—Spain with her high romance, and Asia
with her gorgeous grandeur—who will venture again
to explore? Chateaubriand, Byron, De Stäel, Moore,
Rogers—are not such names barriers to frighten all
aspirants? No—not till America—the new world—becomes
rich and settles herself down in quiet
grandeur—not till her thousand mountains, her
mighty lakes, her stupendous cataracts, and her
boundless prairies, become invested with the magic
of intellectual association—not until history begins
to lose itself in dreamy and indistinct fable, to cast a
vague interest over every charmed spot—will the
bright-winged Ideal rouse from her sleeping nest.
She shrinks from every thing practical, palpable, and
common-place, as the rainbow loses its hues as it approaches
the earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let us then cherish and protect the thoughts and
aspirations which these mighty minds have bequeathed
us. Never did I think to find <span class='sc'>Wilson</span> depreciating
German literature. He is old, and should almost
fear that posterity will retort upon him! A remnant
of the old worshippers of the Ideal yet remain, haunting
the ploughed fields of modern improvement, like
the scattered and timid deer which are sometimes
seen bounding along the margin of civilization. Like
the White Lady of Avenel, they are year by year
fading away—the golden zone which binds their
misty drapery is becoming smaller and smaller—the
clack of the useful mill, or the clashing of machinery,
drowns their voices at their favorite fountains;
and they are forced to shut up the beautiful
visions which haunt their breasts, in the deep sources
of emotion which glow and bubble in silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The source of our most exquisite happiness is the
cause of our keenest sufferings. The constant and
feverish search after perfection soon disgusts the
seeker. Expecting every thing for which the heart
panteth, we rush onward from disappointment to despair.
Hope’s false mirror is reversed; and pleasure
appears as much diminished as it was before enlarged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He who is blest with an organization in which
Ideality holds a conspicuous place, will be sure to
form a complete system of metaphysics, graduated
upon its impulses. If he be permitted to inhale the
odor of the German Ideology, or of Platonism in its
sublime beauty, he will thence be satisfied; and will
yield up his own dreamings to the more powerful enchantments
which the beautiful dead have thrown
around him—for Ideality is the least conceited of
the feelings. It is only proud of its <span class='it'>capacity to enjoy</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was my fortune to be born and educated on the
banks of the Hudson, where the noble river makes a
long sweep westward, affording now an excellent
landing for steamboats; but which, when I first
snuffed up the free mountain air, resounded to nought
but the wild warbling of the merry birds, or the occasional
halloo of the far-off husbandman, as he urged
his reluctant plough through the rich soil. There is
now a nail-factory on the very spot where I used to
stand, watching the glorious sunrise as its golden
light filtered through the trees which crowned the
eastern hill, and lit up the joyous brook which danced
at my feet—while I <span class='it'>felt</span> that the broad and whirling
river at my back, was leaping and quivering in
the gleam. Each tiny grot and harbor which my
young imagination erst peopled with denizens from
the land of dreams, now resounds to the uncouth
“clink of hammers,” or the sacrilegious wheezing
of a steam-engine! When I last visited my native
village—’tis ten years ago—to seek once more the
remembered haunts of childhood, I found a railroad
dépôt on the very spot where the church in which I
was christened once stood, and a cotton factory on
my former bathing-ground by the margin of my dear
old lake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vexed and disappointed, I flung myself along an
old heap of logs which had escaped the demon of improvement,
and were still in their old position,
crumbling quietly and decently to dust. Here I lay
until the sun clambered awkwardly down the western
sky, and the shadows of evening came out from their
hiding places to meet the bat and owl, and hold their
nightly revels in the moonshine. Gradually I sunk
into a new and pleasing state of existence. I had
been reading “Undine,” a literary gem of so pure
and perfect a form and structure, that the only wonder
is how it should have been created by the mere
spontaneous working of the imperfect human brain.
It is now ten years since I read it—nor have I presumed
to look into a modern “translation,” of which
I have heard—and yet you shall see how well I remember
it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Undine is the favorite child of a water-goddess,
and like all fairies with whom I was ever acquainted,
holds her ethereal attributes only at the expense of
her natural affections, and becomes mortal at the
touch of man. Well—her mother being an exception
of a fairy woman, has no small degree of <span class='it'>curiosity</span>
in her composition, and places this darling
daughter of hers under the protection of an old anchorite
who lived in a beautiful green island, all
alone, as he thought; but he was mistaken, as you
shall see: for this very island was the most frequent
haunt of the fairies, gnomes, salamanders, and other
such grave and respectable people—a sort of coffee-house,
in fact, where they met nightly to talk over
the politics of Elfinland, criticise the Queen’s last
head-dress, laugh at Puck’s latest epigram, toss off
their bumper of “mountain dew,” and stagger soberly
to bed under the violet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so, in this wild, fragrant solitude—unknown
to vulgar eyes and therefore unsoiled and untrampled
upon—grew up this flower in all the luxuriant
beauty of mortality, softened and spiritualized by
her yet immortal nature. And, as the grape is most
luscious and tempting the very moment ere it is
tainted by the sun’s unhallowed kisses, and drops, a
disgusting thing, from the green and immortal vine,
so she grew ripe with loveliness and so intense in
beauty, that, Narcissus like, she fell enamored of her
own sweet image, as it was reflected in the pure
spring sacred to the innate Ideal which bubbled
within her own bosom. The old hermit marked
anxiously and tenderly the growth of his young
charge: and when, in the evening time—when the
rose’s bosom swelled and panted beneath the night
wind’s passionate embrace—she came and kissed
his brow and nestled her beautiful curly head in his
bosom, the old man was wild with joy, and his heart
beat again as it did in youth, like the sleeping tide
awakened to convulsions by the gentle moon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But anon a brave and beautiful knight—whose
ancestral castle still frowns above the Rhine, parting
reluctantly, like a decaying beauty, one by one, year
after year, with its fair proportions—came dashing
through the foam to our dainty islet. He had been
hunting in the forest; and a terrible storm coming up—no
doubt set on foot by the mischievous fairies,
who, like all other supernatural beings, are accused of
frequently overturning the economy of a whole world
to advance some particular whim of their own—he
rode wildly through the intricate labyrinths of the
woods for some hours to no purpose, and at length
gave up the reins to his noble steed, who bore him
wherever he would: and, landing on our beautiful
island, the knight saw the twinkle of the anchorite’s
torch, which he had lighted to tell his rosary at the
midnight hour. The stranger was kindly welcomed,
and the hermit’s homely fare cheerfully set before
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now, out peeped Undine—the little rogue—from
her fairy slumbers, with her night-dress scarce
hanging about her beautiful shoulders, and her large
eyes dazzling and sinking into shade like the opal.
Such visions may have broken upon Guido’s dreams,
ere yet his hand had been trained by art to grasp the
impalpable lightning of his mind, and chain it to the
canvas. In vain the old man pleaded and expostulated—nay
once in an angry tone <span class='it'>commanded</span> her to
go back instantly. I wish you could have seen her
then. It was like the uncoiling of a beautiful snake,
disturbed in its playfulness by the rash intruder’s
foot. With eye-balls darting fire—throat swelling
and falling with beautiful rage—and every movement
indicating the contortions of a fiend, who had
in vain endeavored to disguise himself in the robes of
spiritual beauty—she rudely pushed the old man
aside, sprung lightly into the room, and stood, in an
attitude of wild and timid repose, directly in front of
the stranger knight.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>And the knight, being entranced with the supernatural
beauty of Undine, rushed eagerly towards her
with his arms extended, as if he would clasp her to
his bosom; but she shrunk from his approach like
the sensitive plant, which thrillingly feels, yet dares
not meet, man’s touch—and the eager knight embraced
the empty air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I was a little child, I once tried to catch a
beautiful bird that sat singing in a green bush; but
when my hand, certain of its victim, closed to grasp
it, a gleam of loveliness shot across my eyes—a
wild burst of joyous melody smote my ears—and
that bird like a midnight dream, passed from my
sight forever. Hope ceased her guardian watch, and
as she turned her face from me, threw deep black
shadows far into my heart. So felt the strange
knight, as he stood with extended arms motionless
and eyes gazing wildly in the direction whence
Undine had vanished, until the good old hermit came
and laid his hand upon the youth’s shoulder, and
spoke kindly to him—for he knew that his guest
was in a charmed spell, and could no more control
his thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he led the knight, as he would have done a
child, to a beautiful arbor at the bottom of the garden,
where the moon-beams had stolen through the
vine leaves, and were dallying with the dew—for
the tempest had suddenly ceased, and the majestic
night had come forth uncovered, to hold her starry
court—and pointed to a rustic bed made of dry
leaves and moss. Then he blessed him and departed—and
the stranger slept sweetly beneath the sheltering
wings of night. But it was his body alone that
slumbered: for no sooner had he closed his eyes than
a thousand faces, radiant with smiles and witching
tenderness, clustered around him—and, oh rapture!
among them was Undine, who came joyously towards
him, and flung herself confidingly into his arms;
and, as she looked up in his face, he thought he had
passed the cloudy shadows which separate earth
from heaven, and was already in the abode of immortal
bliss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But I will not protract my story. The knight fell
impetuously in love with the little fairy girl, who
told him that she had sacrificed her immortality out
of pure love for him, and promised him every delight
that physical or intellectual longing could possibly
conceive—so long as he was faithful to her: and the
little witch kept her word, and had told him the
truth, too, as you shall presently see—for her father,
Kuhleborn, and all the rest of her fairy acquaintances,
gradually forsook her, and she held no more
communion with the winged spirit of the ideal world,
save with that <span class='it'>one</span> who is ever near the object of her
anxiety and love—her mother! Aye, that fairy
mother, in the still star-light, when Undine slept like
a rose upon the bosom of her lord, would come and
fan her with her musical wings, and breathe fragrance
over her, and spangle her hair with tears of love and
fondness—and then the knight would wake and kiss
them up, and fold her more closely to his breast; and
the mother would glide noiselessly away, and sit in
pleasant sadness by the river’s bank, until the garish
day-light frightened her back to her haunts in the
deep forest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well—this lasted for some time; the old hermit
sanctioning with his smiles the endearments of the
fond pair; for he knew that Undine’s only chance of
happiness was in the constancy of the stranger
knight—for she had forfeited her immortal nature,
and trusted all her rich treasure of hope and happiness
to a human love! How precious the cargo!
how frail the bark! what a little tempest will shatter
this slight vessel, and strew the glittering fragments
of its freight upon the sands!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anon came a gallant array of knights from his father’s
court, to conduct our bewildered lover back to
life. Congratulations upon his safety, and the evident
joy which dwelt upon the features of his friends,
at length subdued him, and he consented to return to
the gay world. He sought once more his Undine in
her favorite bower; and as he approached, a strain
of most exquisite music stole upon his ear. He listened,
and heard the voice of his own—his beloved—pour
forth her soul:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wildly he rushed into the arbor, and clasped the
fairy woman over and over to his breast—swearing
and protesting most vehemently that he would only
go and see his father and receive his blessing, and
his mother’s kiss, and his sister’s farewell embrace,
and then straightway return to the island and his fairy
bride. And so, he again pressed her little bosom to
his own, and kissed her lips, and she, poor thing!
believed him—for she was nothing but a woman then,
and had lost her fairy sagacity—and twining her
beautiful limbs around him, as if she would grow
there forever, she flooded his bosom with her pure
warm tears; and gently removing her now insensible
form to a green bank, strown with violets, and calling
the good old hermit from the hut, he rushed out,
and mounting his gallant steed, dashed wildly across
the Rhine, and bent his way to his father’s castle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now I must let you into a very important
secret; which is, that our gallant knight had already
wooed and won the daughter of a powerful nobleman,
whose castle was on the opposite bank of the river
to his father’s,—and the marriage contracts and
settlements had all been made and ratified by the old
people. The lady was a pretty, unmeaning, blue-eyed
girl, and knew no better than to fall in love
according to law and the command of her father;
and she therefore made no opposition, but merely
waited in listless indifference, till her husband should
release her virgin bosom from its bursting boddice,
and lead her to the nuptial chamber. Of what <span class='it'>that</span>
was, she had no possible idea—or, if she had, nobody
was ever the wiser of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so the knight dashed onwards, outstripping all
his friends, until he arrived breathless at his father’s
castle, scarce knowing where he was or where he had
been. But all question or surmise was smothered in
the joy occasioned by his return. Feasts and festivals
were the order of the day—and our knight was
eternally stuck alongside of the blue-eyed girl he
was to marry. But he thought of nothing but a pair
of large black orbs that used to dart lightning into
his soul, when he was on the little island; and he
never heard his intended bride utter a word without
thrilling, by contrast, all over, with the memory of
that fairy music which soothed him in Undine’s bower.
And he saw her in his dreams—and even when
he was wide awake, his soul still lingered round that
charmed spot, hallowed by the presence of immortal
love. But earthly ties are more palpable than the
air-wrought links of the soul’s affections, and find a
stronger hold in our gross and earthly nature; and
so, day after day, the dream of his sweet Undine
became dimmer and more fleeting; and at last, like
one intoxicated with glorious wine who sinks to sleep
dreamless, he tumbled listlessly back to earth, and
his fairy bride was remembered no more. The day
for his marriage was fixed, and the time was spent in
a continual round of feasting and merry making.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Where was Undine all this time? What did she?
Tell us all about her. In good time you shall hear
the whole sad story.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Have you ever, dear reader, journeyed in the hot
sun-shine, your brain literally broiling in the heat,
and the dust driving, like a sleet-storm, into your
face, filling your eyes, ears and throat with minute
particles, which irritated you almost to phrenzy—and,
when almost ready to drop down dead with
fatigue, thirst and despair, suddenly seen, upon turning
an abrupt angle in the path, a fair smiling woodland
lawn stretching before you, and a cool, limpid
stream of water gushing out from among the flowers,
and a whole orchard of birds singing gaily in the
branches? So, after the dusty and perplexing toils
of life, return we to Undine and her strange fortunes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ah, she was a guilty thing—that beautiful and
fairy girl! for what right had she to sacrifice her
celestial nature, and become a mere thing of earth
for worms to feed upon, just for a few mortal kisses?
True, true—but those kisses! oh, what rapture lies
hidden in the spell of that hour when the divine soul,
with its cold immaculate brightness, yields to the
warmer thrillings of terrestrial love, and melts away
in ecstasy beneath the glance of passion-lighted eyes—the
pressure of warm sweet lips! Immortals live
in a bright round of perpetual purity and lustre. No
o’erwrought heaving of the breast—no momentary
thrilling of agonising bliss—no melting climax of
joy, concentrating in its burning focus a whole life of
hope and aspiration—repays the weary soul for all
her watchings. Undine had drunk of the intoxicating
draught till her lips grew to the goblet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ah, who can blame her? Who has not tasted
moments of earthly bliss so intense that were immortality’s
brightest visions spread palpably before him,
he would spurn them all?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon after the knight left the little island, our good
old hermit, upon going to Undine’s apartment, as was
his wont, saw her not. He searched every where—the
garden, the river bank, the thicket which surrounded
his little plantation, were all examined in
vain. She had fled away upon the wings of love, and,
panting with toil and exhaustion, came at last to her
knight’s castle, and ran like lightning through the
court. What saw she? Lights were glancing in
every niche,—loud and boisterous noises of merriment
and gaiety echoed through the passages—and,
bracing her little heart with the strength of despair,
Undine rushed wildly to the great saloon, and saw
the knight—her own beloved—him for whose love
Heaven and its joys she had lightly thrown away—leading
the pretty blue-eyed German girl to the altar.
The white-robed priest was there—and, as he completed
the ceremony, he raised his unconscious hands
and blessed them in the name of the virgin. And the
harp and tambour struck up their wild music—and
away fled the bride and bride-groom with the joyous
throng of revellers to the dance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Undine was not yet <span class='it'>all</span> a woman. Revenge, as it
were the dying spark of her immortal nature, burst
brightly up in her bosom; and, rushing wildly out
into the forest, she fell upon her knees and cried
vehemently for her mother. She was at her side,
and gazing wistfully and fondly upon her, ere the
echoes had ceased whispering in the woods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Execute me this first and only prayer, dear, dear
mother!” said Undine—“and forever I release you
from the charge of your most miserable child!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What would you, sweet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Strike <span class='it'>him</span> dead!—aye! but wait——” and her
eyes flashed and her whole form seemed convulsed
with demoniac passion—“wait till he enfolds her to
his heart, as he has done <span class='it'>me</span> so often—and kisses her—hell
and furies! as he has kissed <span class='it'>me</span> so many thousand
times—<span class='it'>then</span> strike him, mother—let him wither
in her arms, like a dead viper, until they shall both
sink in base, earthly corruption together. Mother!
mother! grant me this, as you love your child!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On went the marriage feast—and never had Rhine’s
blue waters wafted gayer notes or wilder revelry
than echoed from the old baronial castle, where our
young knight was immolating the beauteous dove that
had nestled in his bosom on the altar of worldly pride
and miscalled duty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when the feast was over, and the bride was led
blushing to her chamber, a strange thrill shot through
the bosom of the knight as he was about to follow,
and he almost staggered into the room. The bride,
frightened at his convulsive motions, ran and put her
naked arms about him, and he unconsciously leaned
his head upon her bosom—when suddenly a terrific
burst of thunder shook the castle to its foundation,
and the face of the knight became livid and distorted—and,
even as Undine had prayed, he withered away
ghastily in his bride’s arms, and they both fell shrieking
to the earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The morning sun rose clear and beautiful over the
old ivy crowned castle—but there were mourning
and tears beneath that venerable roof; and when the
sun slanted across the sighing forest tops at evening,
they bore the young and noble knight to his peaceful
home, and laid him to rest among the flowers of the
green valley—and when all had departed with sorrowful
footsteps from the spot, and the stealthy moon
came with her bright limbs scantily clad in gauzy
clouds, to meet her lover on the hill, she looked upon
the celestial form of Undine, bending in sorrow and
repentance o’er her lover’s grave—and the dew and
the star-light mingling together, dissolved her frail
and beautiful outline, until it mixed with the invisible
odors that played above the flowers—and the next
day there was bubbling a bright spring at the knight’s
head, the waters of which, diverging into two graceful
channels, clasped like loving arms the form of him
Undine so fatally had loved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now, thou beautiful spirit, farewell forever!
In thy companionship have we found solace from the
weight of mortality’s burthen—and while sympathising
with thy unhappy and yet blissful fate, have
learned to feel that to preserve an immortal nature,
it is necessary to forget that we have mortal passions.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> was one of those lovely autumnal days of which
we all often dream, and so fondly wish to enjoy, when
lying upon the bed of sickness; such a day as we love
to dwell upon in imagination, when we are closely
housed and sitting by a sparkling fire during the long
freezing winter nights.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, it was such a day as this that my friend Ned
K—— and I started through the rich country which
lies north of Dayton. The sun was just rising, glorious
and unobscured by cloud or mist, his early rays
dancing gaily upon the parti-colored foliage, like
millions of those little bright elfins which people
the glowing imagination of the oriental improvisitore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Feeling the influence of the early morning air upon
our spirits, we pricked forward our steeds; and as
the noble animals danced over the earth, our hearts
leaped to our lips, and we gave forth their joyousness
in the glowing language which the poets numbered
before us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We gazed up into the deep blue vault of heaven
above us; we saw the moon sailing along in cloudless
majesty, and the stars peeping through their lingering
drapery of darkness, and we raised our voices,
and in gladness and lightness of heart, we shouted
aloud. And the birds—those ceaseless lutes of the
summer morning air—warbled a response.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We soon became short of breath; our lungs had
expanded too freely, and our blood was too fiery after
its slow and even circulation during the lethargy of
the late night—our spirits boiled over, and like
everything which boils over, they soon sank into a
contrasting calmness, and we discovered that we were
riding side and side with all of the sedateness of a
Quaker preacher when he arrived in sight of the meeting
house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How far does your old uncle reside from here?”
I asked anxiously of my friend Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be patient, my good fellow, and we will soon get
there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish we were there now, I am so anxious to see
the old hero. You say he was an active participator
in some of the principal incidents of our revolution?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was, and that old musket which I showed you
yesterday, accompanied him in many of his adventures.
From the first bloodshed at Lexington till the
final capture at Yorktown, did that hero bare his
breast to the storm of the revolution. His blood has
bathed the soil of many a battle-field, and innumerable
are the hair-breadth perils which he has passed
through. You are partial to these tales of perils,
L——, and you shall now be gratified to your heart’s
content.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>My heart leaped with joy, and I began already to
calculate the time and expense which it would require
to write a volume of his adventures; and what
edification it would be to the devourers of omnivorous
literature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is he a great talker?” I immediately asked, for,
but a short time previous I had made several trips to
see pioneers solely for the purpose of committing to
paper their adventures; and others, after much trouble
I had reached their domicils, I found as uncommunicative
as a Saracenic mute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He loves to talk, and nothing pleases him more
than to have such patient and willing listeners as
you are; with you he will talk from morning till
night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I rubbed my hands with delight; the volume which
had danced before my imagination for a few minutes
past, now swelled in size from an octavo to a folio;
and my impatience to see the hero, almost became
insupportable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is one failing which my old uncle has,”
continued my friend, “and that is, he possesses a
very exuberant imagination.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So much the better,” I exclaimed, “then his recitation
will not continue on that dead level, which
gives such prolixity to a narrative; now and then
a flight of the imagination adds a marvellous spice
to such things; a single narration, you know, only
draws the picture and shades it—it is left for imagination
to paint it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you do not precisely understand me; I mean
that my uncle—who is getting old now, you know—is
in the habit, if allowed to commence in that way,
to dwell for hours together upon the most marvellous
adventures, which he draws solely from imagination,
and confounds with his real ones; but leave this to
me, and I will set him on the right track; by the
way, there is one incident connected with his very
mutable life which I must prevail upon him to relate;
I call his imagined adventures yarns—so let us ride
forward, for yonder is the house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We dashed down the long lane—lined on each
side with towering poplar trees, whose pointed tops
reached far above the surrounding trees—and we
soon stood at the door of the old soldier’s house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We dismounted, and giving our horses to an attendant,
we entered the house, and the first person that
we saw was the old veteran himself. He hurried
towards us—by aid of a stout cane—and bade us
welcome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Truly was the old man’s appearance equal to my
ideal of him; his form—though somewhat bent with
age—had once, I could easily perceive, been tall
and sinewy; and his limbs still retained a degree of
that muscular power, which had so repeatedly contributed
to bring him safe from <span class='it'>melées</span>, where weaker
men had perished. The old man’s hair was white as
the snow, and accumulating years had continued to
thin it, till only two small locks were left.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With sparkling eyes and animated features, the
veteran grasped our hands, and gave us a true soldier’s
welcome; and then leading us to a small room, he
introduced us to his sister—a venerable and corpulent
matron of fifty—and then to what was still more
pleasurable, a smoking breakfast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After partaking of as luxuriant a <span class='it'>déjeuner</span> as ever
caused an epicure’s eyes to dance, we wandered
around the farm—the old soldier limping along with
us—and after bestowing the necessary eulogiums
upon the fine appearance of his Berkshire pigs, his imported
stallion, and his Durham cattle, we returned
to the house; and then partaking of a glass of cider
wine, (which excellent fluid needs but a high price
to become as regal as champaigne) we got the old
man seated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This young friend of mine,” began my cautious
companion, “is passionately fond of revolutionary
tales, and as he is now engaged in writing sketches
embodying all the adventures of the revolution,” here
Ned gave me a meaning look, “he wishes to hear a
few of your adventures; couldn’t you gratify him,
uncle?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The veteran propped his rheumatic leg upon a chair,
and laid aside his cane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha! he wishes to hear tales of the wars, does
he? Well, then, ’spose I tell him about the death of
poor old Joshua Brews——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, uncle! I think something less melancholy
will please him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t like melancholy tales,” I said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, ’spose I tell him about the fight that Ben
Bunker and me had——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That I <span class='it'>know</span> wouldn’t please him,” and Ned
quickly whispered in my ear “a <span class='it'>yarn</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, I have it now; tell him about ‘The Rescue
at the Eleventh Hour.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hate to tell that; my blood freezes whenever I
think of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Tis surprising,” thought I, “how compatible it
is for old men to delight in lies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which of the tales mentioned would you rather
hear; we will leave the decision to you, won’t we,
uncle?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly, my son; but recollect that the fight
which Ben Bunker and me had <span class='it'>is mighty</span> entertaining.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have no doubt of it, sir; still, as I have taken
a fancy to ‘The Rescue at the Eleventh Hour,’ you
would oblige me by relating that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old veteran bowed, swallowed a glass of wine,
and commenced the tale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The days of which I now speak, my son, were
pregnant with perils. When we retired to our beds
at night, we knew not what the morning might bring
forth. We might hear of the death of a father, mother,
or sister, by the ruthless hand of a British forager,
or equally sanguine tory. Or else our ears would be
greeted with the wail of some outcast, who had travelled
all night to flee the ravagers of his property.
Every hour was pregnant with news, either in favor
or against the interests of our country. The British,
at the time of which I speak, were overrunning the
land, devastating the fairest farms, and murdering or
making captive their inhabitants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was then young—but twenty years had passed
over my head, and, of course, I possessed all the
sanguine nature of youth: added to which, my soul
was kindled to anger by the horrid accounts which
reached us daily of British brutality. My father,
who had fought in the old French and Indians wars,
had taught me to despise oppression, but to worship
freedom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Early impressions seldom fade from the mind, but
become more vivid with the increase of our years,
and so had the sentiments which my father had taught
me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The next farm to that of my father’s, belonged to
Charles Worthington, who had but one child, a
daughter, about three years younger than I was.
Even yet, after a lapse of fifty years, the blood bounds
through my veins, and my heart heaves with an unusual
emotion, as I think of that fair girl. Ah, she was
surpassing fair, but yet her beauty was rivalled by
her goodness of heart and her amiability. With a
skin of the fairest white, deep blue eyes, forehead
high and expansive, and features altogether classical,
she was one whom any one could love; and, excuse
me, my son, for indulging in reflections which may
be of no interest to you, but these pictures, when
they do arise in the memory, are still intensely vivid,
while their being so long ago enacted, gives each
small incident an interest with me, which to you
may appear unworthy of a single thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lucy Worthington and I met, and we <span class='it'>loved</span>, and it
was that deep love which casts its hue over all our
future actions. It was the first love—when those
whirlwind passions of the mind are first awakened to
activity, and, like the sun rising over the landscape,
throws its hues upon every object, and tinges them of
its own peculiar color.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For months Lucy and I were almost inseparable
companions—we consumed the greater part of our
days wandering in the fields and woods, gathering
flowers and listening to each other’s words; and my
greatest ambition was to please her, my only thoughts
to elicit a smile of love from her bright eye. Thus
passed away the days till the destroyer came.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was a bright morning in summer. The sun had
just risen, and I was gazing upon its early rays, as
they threw the shadows of the dancing foliage through
the window upon the opposite wall; when I heard a
distant crack of a gun, which was immediately followed
by another, then another, and then others, in
such quick succession that I could not count them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suspecting that all was not right at our neighbor’s
house, I sprang out of bed, hurriedly drew on my
clothes, and, without speaking to any of our family,
hastened over to Worthington’s. Before I reached
the house I saw a blue smoke hanging over it; but
not a human being was to be met; all was as lonely
as a city of the dead. I leaped the fence and hurried
to the house, and, oh! what a scene was suddenly presented
to my sight! The father, the mother, and their
only child, were stretched on the floor and weltering
in their blood. The parents were dead, but the daughter—although
evidently dying—still retained her
speech and consciousness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Language would convey but a very faint impression
of the agony which tortured my breast. I threw
myself by her body and groaned aloud. It was the
first misery which I had ever experienced, and it
came upon me as the long accumulating avalanche
upon the family of the mountaineer, and I was suddenly
and unexpectedly overwhelmed with misery;
and in the poignancy of the moment I cried like a
child. But that poor girl—although gradually dying—whispered
hope into my ear, and pointing to heaven,
she bade me gaze there, where we would, ere
long, meet to be separated no more. And for the
first time in my life, did I direct my thoughts to the
footstool of the everlasting throne, and addressed a
prayer to its King for the gentle soul which was about
to be placed in his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Charles,’ she exclaimed faintly, as she observed
my agony, ‘I am dying: let all this pass, for I forgive
those who committed the deed, as I hope to be
forgiven myself in heaven. Do not seek to retaliate
upon those deluded soldiers, who know nothing but
to obey the behests of their king; why this useless
grief? You see that I do not weep, although the pale
face of my poor old mother lies at my side,’ and she
placed her pale hand upon the rigid face of her parent,
and, despite her efforts to prevent it, a tear
forced itself from under her eyelid, and rolled down
her cheek, as she gazed upon those dear features,
now calmed in death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Charles, I am going—I forgive—forgive—’ and
thus she expired. I threw myself on her body and
groaned aloud, but in a moment a thought flashed
through my mind, and immediately I was as calm as
a statue. I arose and then sinking on one knee, I
swore a solemn oath, and I prayed that the Dispenser
of life might grant me mine together with health,
till I should have fulfilled that oath, and so long as
life lasted, I vowed to devote all my energies and
means to its consummation; and then, with a pale
face but a calm brow, I hastened home. Knowing
that those who had committed this diabolical deed,
would travel rapidly for fear of that just retribution
which they knew would follow them, I hurriedly
seized my rifle, and taking with me but a few bullets,
I rapidly followed the tracks of the murderers. I ran
at my greatest speed during the whole of that day.
Their tracks led me into the depths of a thinly settled
country, but the soil being loose, I could trace the
deep impressions of their horses’ feet with the greatest
ease. At dark I had not overtaken them, but
with all the indefatigableness of one seeking revenge
for a deadly and vital injury, I now groped my way
over a rocky country, often stooping to examine
whether I was still on their tracks. Finally the
country became so rocky that I entirely lost all traces
of my victims, and with a brain burning from disappointed
revenge, I prepared to pass the night under a
ledge of rocks which protruded in the road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had heard the name of the leader of this party,
and although I could not seek reparation at the present,
yet I prepared to lie down with a stern determination
to follow him to the four corners of the
earth before I would forego the revenge I had in store
for him. With a heart aching with grief and disappointment,
I prepared to throw myself upon my flinty
bed, when, casting my sight to the left, I observed a
lurid hue dwelling upon the tops of some tall
trees below me, and plainly indicating that a fire was
burning beneath them. This fire might have been
kindled by the very person whom I sought. I immediately
shouldered my rifle, and, in my eagerness
to reach the spot, nearly ran over the brow of a high
precipice, down which had I fallen, I would have
been dashed to atoms against the rocks below. Avoiding
the impending danger by deviating to the right,
I reached the level country, where travelling was
comparatively easy, and started at a rapid gait for the
distant light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The country—now so thickly settled—was
almost a wilderness, and still abounded with wild and
savage animals, which—as I was aware—seek their
prey by night. I observed the strictest caution, lest
some lurking panther should pounce upon me; and
then, being necessitated to shoot it, I would alarm
my enemies. By the greatest exertion, I avoided
one of these animals, and in the course of several
hours, I approached the fire. The country was
studded thickly with giant oaks, whose matted
branches and thick foliage cast a deep gloom beneath
them; but from this contrast the fire appeared more
brilliant, and shot far out into the surrounding darkness,
a gleam of brightness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I neared the fire unobserved, but what were my
sensations upon perceiving arrayed around it the very
persons I sought. For the first time since morning, I
felt a degree of hope swell my breast, as I gazed
upon the murderers of all I loved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ten horses were hobbled close by me, and scenting
me if they did not see me, they snorted and gazed
in the direction where I was hid, but their masters
were so busily engaged in conversing and boasting
over their day’s exploits, that they heard not these
never-failing omens, that danger was nigh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The spirit of revenge grew strong in me as I beheld
those whom I had labored all day to see; and
that wish which troubled me now was, that I had not
brought along with me a party sufficiently formidable
to have taken them all prisoners, and thus revenge
would be gratified by piece-meal. I was not
long in deciding what to do. Observing the officer
who commanded the party sitting among the rest, I
singled him out as the first victim to be offered upon
the altar of my vengeance. I cautiously cocked my
gun, and taking a deliberate aim at his breast, I pulled
the trigger—but the sparks missed the pan, and the
gun did not go off. The men heard the noise, and
several saw the sparks fly, and in a moment every
man was on his feet, and gazing intently at the spot
where I stood; but in a second of time I had re-cocked
my gun, and taking another aim, I fired. The officer
sprang up, screamed, and fell upon his face. With
curses, several of the soldiers rushed forward towards
the spot where I lay, but with superior woodsmanship
I evaded them and fled into the depths of the woods,
and taking a circuitous route, I came to the fire again
at the other side. Every man had left in pursuit of
me but two, who were busily stripping off the coat
of the officer. I again fired and one of the soldiers
fell. With a yell and a fearful oath, I was met as I
turned to flee, by one of the soldiers who had been
pursuing me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I drew a knife, the soldier drew his bayonet, and
we engaged in a desperate encounter. Knowing that
the noise we made would soon guide others to the
spot, and that I would assuredly be captured, I commenced
a retrograde movement for the purpose of
effecting my escape, when I was clinched by an iron
hand from behind, and the person missing at the same
time a firm foot-hold, he fell to the earth, bearing me
with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, how I struggled! how fearfully I wielded my
knife! but it was not that I feared dying—what was
life to me then? It was that I feared being foiled in
my revenge, and with this fear uppermost in my
mind, I hurled my knife about me with giant energy;
with the maddened and thoughtless desperation of
the panther, when she struggles for her screaming
young, did I battle for my revenge; but now they
rushed up upon every side—they threw themselves
upon me—they bore me again to the earth, but this
time senseless, and when I became conscious, I was
lying on my back, and bound hands and feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The soldier whom I had shot, died a few moments
after receiving his wound; but the officer still survived,
although mortally wounded—the ball having
broke, in its course, the sternum and ribs, and passed
directly through his lungs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The soldiers soon gathered around the spot where
I lay—their eyes gleaming hate, and their rough
features expressing all the atrocity of their nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Accursed Yankee!’ exclaimed one, ‘would to
God you were possessed of nine lives, that we might
glut our hatred of you, by depriving you of each
by inches,’ and the monster ground his teeth, and
kicked me with such force as to nearly deprive me
of breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Depraved and blood-thirsty rebel!’ thundered
another, ‘what fiend from hell tempted you to this
diabolical act?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘The same fiend which tempted you to murder
my family,’ I answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Immediately the man’s gaze of hatred began to
soften in its expression, and my keen eyes detected a
slight emotion dwelling, for an instant, upon his features,
as he turned to the first speaker and muttered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I told you not to commit that murderous deed;
still you would persist, and now you see how speedily
retribution has winged its flight to you. By heaven,
this man has served you justly, and ought not to
perish for it.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘No power save that of heaven can prevent his
dying this day,’ muttered the other through his
clenched teeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Beware how you speak to me, sir,’ said the
other; the man made an inclination of the head, and
walked off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The young man—for he appeared to be no older
than myself—again cast his glance upon me, and
what a change was there in the expression of his eyes!
It was like the mother’s glance when her sleeping
infant lies upon her lap; or the father’s, as he looks
for the last time upon his condemned son, who was
the hope and the pride of his declining years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘What age are you?’ he kindly asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Had you not murdered all I held dear on earth,
I would next autumn be twenty years old; as it is, I
never expect to be older than nineteen years and nine
months.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘So young, and yet so determined and brave! It
must not be; they shall not deprive you of life, when
you might make such a powerful auxiliary to our
cause. Listen to me, young stranger. Would you be
willing to repudiate all your rebel prejudices and
join the cause of your king, if you could obtain your
freedom?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Life is sweet, and who would not at that age dissemble
a little and play the hypocrite for such a precious
boon? I pretended to undergo a great internal
emotion, and spoke long of the glory and righteousness
of our cause; but my policy at last made me a
proselyte to his arguments, and I yielded to his proposal;
and the young man left me. My eyes sought
him constantly after that, and several times I discovered
him in earnest conversation with the wounded
officer. Towards noon the young man obtained an
opportunity to speak with me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I have been trying,’ said he, ‘to prevail upon
our officer to release you upon the conditions which
I proposed this morning, but he obstinately refuses,
and persists in making you the victim of his revenge;
but be of good cheer. I think he cannot last long,
his countenance momentarily changes, and when he
dies I will free you at all hazards,’ and with these
words he left me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An hour had not passed away when the young
man’s suspicions were fulfilled. The officer was
seized with the most violent paroxysm; his features
worked fearfully, and it required several men to hold
down his writhing limbs. Strange as it may appear
to the tender-hearted, there was one who gazed upon
that man’s terrible throes with feelings partaking of
pleasure, although the sufferer was my fellow mortal.
Under any other circumstances, I would have stood
by that man’s side with tearful eyes, but the cause
of my present stoicism is evident. The officer soon
expired, and immediately after his burial I was set
at liberty; and soon afterwards signed my name to
an instrument binding me a liege subject and soldier
of his Majesty King George.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a change was there now in the conduct of
these soldiers towards me! Instead of the brutal
language and fearful threats which they had hurled
at me, they were now declared friends and ready to
share with me their last morsel. We ate together,
we drank each other’s health, and we slept upon the
same blanket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The deeds which I had perpetrated, and which
had deprived two of their number of life, were apparently
forgotten, for they looked upon me now as a
formidable addition to their party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Many an expression which dwells upon the risible
faculties, belies the secret thoughts of the breast, and
it was so with the glad expression which mantled my
features as I travelled along with them, externally
appearing joyful, but heavy and sad within.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did not neglect the oath which I had made; I
had not forgotten the pale serene features of one
whom I had ever worshipped, as they lay in the
calmness of death; but whenever I closed my eyes
those mild and fading eyes were before me, with
their love and holy resignation vividly expressed,
and their glow rapidly fading.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘The time will soon arrive,’ I thought as I looked
upon my reckless comrades, ‘when you will all be
stiffened in death, pale monuments of the revenge of
one whom you have so vitally injured—thoughtless
fools! do you imagine that I am but as a brute which
perishes, that I can so soon forget the misery which
you have caused me?’ And in the secret chambers of
my breast there was a wild orgie of passions, in anticipation
of the rich feast which my revenge would
soon enjoy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The next morning we started over a mountainous
country, committing several depredations on the way.
With the rest I fired several valuable barns, for all
of which I afterwards remunerated their owners.
This depraved spirit upon my part gave great joy to
my companions, and when we reached a section of
the royal army under command of Cornwallis, I received
a smile of approbation from the general, as
reward for my loyalty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now the wishes of my heart were about to be
gratified. I was dispatched on a secret service, in
company with several of the murderers of Lucy
Worthington, and now I determined to put into execution
that revenge, whose flame could no longer lie
smothered in my breast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About sunset we arrived in a deep gorge—the
bed of many a mountain torrent—where we prepared
for our night’s lodging. At midnight I cautiously
arose; the fire had died away to embers, and
every thing around was wrapped in gloom. The
deep and regular breathing of the sleepers promised
me an uninterrupted opportunity for the execution of
my purpose. I seized a pistol; the principal murderer
lay locked in total unconsciousness of his fate.
I cautiously drew near him, and placed the muzzle
of the pistol against his temple, and even then the
poor wretch smiled! Perhaps at that moment he
was wandering in his dream to the home of his parents,
and beheld the smiles of a glad mother, and
felt upon his lips the warm kiss of a welcoming sister;
or, perhaps, he imagined that he held in his
arms the fragile form of some loved one, and smiled
as he gazed upon the glow of her welcoming eye, and
felt the sealing kiss of her love. Is it not happier to
leave the world under these bright illusions than when
the mind is awake, and cold judgment already calculating
the chances of an immortal and happy future?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I pulled the trigger; the loud explosion started
every man to his feet, but with a yell of the wildest
joy I cleared the spot, and soon was buried among
the tangled bushes, which grew plentifully around.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now the deep-mouthed bay of a blood-hound,
which we had brought with us, reverberated among
the old rocks in the gorge, and soon I heard the voices
of those who were following the animal, close by my
lurking place. At once I comprehended my danger—that
the dog was on my track, and with my teeth
clenched, with desperate determination I rushed from
my place of concealment, closely followed by the
excited and enraged animal. In a few moments the
dog reached me, and springing, seized me by the coat
collar. I grasped him by the throat, and with all the
nervous energy of one in my circumstance, I throttled
him; but the furious animal—as if he was aware of
the importance of his grip—retained his firm hold,
despite my powerful efforts to free myself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The soldiers rushed up, and with many a fearful
oath and rude blow, they forced my hands behind
my body and securely bound them in that position;
and then with furious cries of exultation they dragged
me back to camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the morning I was unanimously condemned to
be shot, but in all the plenitude of their mercy, they
granted me two hours to make my peace with heaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now I was left alone with but my own thoughts
for company. I was condemned and must die in two
hours—but two short hours had I left, to take my
leave of this world, and prepare for a voyage, I knew
not where—to leave this world which had ever been
before but a garden of roses. Then the dreadful
truth at once flashed on my mind! to leave all, my
father, mother, sisters, friends, and all those who had
ever met me with a smile; whose roughest words
were blessings, whose prayers were ever my own.
Ah, how hard it is to die when the bright clouds of
youth cluster around our horizon; when the mind is
yet young and free from the diseases which the experiences
of a rude world engender! When the physical
faculties are all active, and most capable of contributing
to our enjoyment; and when death appears
but a monster to the young mind whose riper faculties
teach us to hope for a glorious future.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is hard indeed, and the rapid approach of my
last moments only enhanced my agony. The time
drew nigh and I saw no hope of succor; and it was
<span class='it'>now</span> that the dreadful thought intruded itself, that
there was no longer hope—that I <span class='it'>must</span> die, and before
many minutes more be but a pale bleeding corpse.
My heart ached, my feelings grew insupportable, and
I groaned aloud in the bitterest agony. Ah! the horrors
of that moment! All the most poignant sufferings
of a life time, if converged in one breast, could
not have tortured more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“While in this state of horror, I chanced to look
towards the top of the rocks which lined the gorge,
and with surprise I beheld the same young man who
had previously saved my life. He caught my glance,
and with his hand motioned me to silence, and then
instantly disappeared. What could this mean? We
had left that individual in the army when we left it.
Let it mean what it might it augured well, and immediately
a complete reaction of feelings took place
in my breast. I became calm and apparently careless
of my fate, for I felt that I had a friend close
by, who was willing and able to save me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The time for the execution of my sentence arrived,
and with a file of soldiers as a guard, I was led
to the fatal tree. A bandage was brought forward,
but I refused it, and bade them with a loud voice
hurry with the execution. The file of soldiers, with
loaded muskets, were drawn in a line fronting me,
and I was bade to kneel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now all was a deep silence; you might have
heard a pin drop, and then was heard the voice of the
one in command—‘Attention, men! make ready,
take aim—fire’—and I rolled on the earth a bleeding
corpse——.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is one of my uncle’s <span class='it'>yarns</span>,” said my friend
Ned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pshaw!”</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Poetical Remains of the late Lucretia Maria Davidson,
Collected and Arranged by her Mother: with a Biography
by Miss Sedgwick. Lea and Blanchard:
Philadelphia.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Some few months since, we had occasion to speak of
“The Biography and Poetical Remains of the late Margaret
Miller Davidson”—a work given to the public by Washington
Irving. In common with all who read, we had been
deeply interested in the narrative set forth. The portrait of
the young and beautiful enthusiast, simply yet most effectively
painted by one who touches nothing which he does
not adorn, could not have failed to excite our warmest sympathies;
and we dwelt upon the pleasing yet melancholy
theme with a lingering delight. Of the biographical portion
of the book we said, indeed, what every one says, and most
justly—that nothing could be more intensely pathetic. In
respect, however, to the “Poetical Remains,” the <span class='it'>tone</span> of
our observations was not fully in accordance with that of
the mass of our contemporaries. Without calling in question
the extreme <span class='it'>precocity</span> of the child—a precocity truly
wonderful—we were forced, in some slight measure, to dissent
from that extravagant eulogium, which had its origin,
beyond doubt, in a confounding of the interest felt in the
poetess and her sad fortunes, with a legitimate admiration
of her works. We did not, in truth, conceive it to be either
honest or necessary, to mislead in any degree the public
taste or opinion, by styling “Lenore,” as it exists, a fine
poem, merely because its author <span class='it'>might</span> have written a fine
poem had she lived. We emphasize the “might”; for the
history of all intellect demonstrates that the point is a questionable
one indeed. The analogies of Nature are universal;
and just as the most rapidly growing herbage is the most
speedy in its decay—just as the ephemera struggles to perfection
in a day only to perish in that day’s decline—so
the mind is early matured only to be early in its decadence;
and when we behold in the eye of infancy the soul of the
adult, it is but indulging in a day dream to hope for any
farther proportionate development. Should the prodigy
survive to ripe age, a mental imbecility, not far removed
from idiocy itself, is too frequently the result. From this
rule the exceptions are rare indeed; but it should be observed
that, when the exception does occur, the intellect is
of a Titan cast even to the days of its extreme senility, and
acquires renown not in one, but in all the wide fields of
fancy and of reason.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lucretia Maria Davidson, the subject of the memoir now
before us, and the elder of the two sweet sisters who have
acquired so much of fame prematurely, had not, like Margaret,
an object of poetical emulation in her own family.
In her genius, be it what it may, there is more of self-dependence—less
of the imitative. Her mother’s generous
romance of soul may have stimulated, but did not instruct.
Thus although she has actually given less <span class='it'>evidence</span> of power
(in our opinion) than Margaret—less written proof—still
its <span class='it'>indication</span> must be considered at higher value. Both
perished at sixteen. Margaret, we think, has left the better
poems—certainly the more precocious—while Lucretia
evinces more unequivocally the soul of the poet. In our
August number we quoted in full some stanzas composed
by the former at eight years of age. The latter’s earliest
effusions are dated at fourteen. Yet the first compositions
of the two seem to us of nearly equal merit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The most elaborate production of Margaret is “Lenore,”
of which we have just now spoken. It was written not long
before her death, at the age of fifteen, after patient reflection,
with much care, and with all that high resolve to do something
for fame with which the reputation of her sister had
inspired her. Under such circumstances, and with the early
poetical education which she could not have failed to receive,
we confess that, granting her a trifle more than average
talent, it would have been rather a matter for surprise had
she produced a worse, than had she produced a better poem
than “Lenore.” Its <span class='it'>length</span>, viewed in connexion with its
keeping, its unity, its adaptation, and its completeness (and
all these are points having reference to artistical <span class='it'>knowledge</span>
and perseverance) will impress the critic more favorably
than its fancy, or any other indication of poetic power. In
all the more important qualities we have seen far—very far
finer poems than “Lenore” written at a much earlier age
than fifteen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Amir Khan,” the longest and chief composition of Lucretia,
has been long known to the reading public. It was
originally published, with others, in a small volume to which
Professor Morse, of the American Society of Arts, contributed
a Preface. Partly through the Professor, yet no doubt partly
through their own merits, the poems found their way to the
laureate, Southey, who, after his peculiar fashion, and not
unmindful of his previous <span class='it'>furores</span> in the case of Kirke
White, Chatterton, and others of precocious ability, or at
least celebrity, thought proper to <span class='it'>review</span> them in the Quarterly.
This was at a period when we humbled ourselves,
with a subserviency which would have been disgusting had
it not been ludicrous, before the crudest critical <span class='it'>dicta</span> of
Great Britain. It pleased the laureate, after some squibbing
in the way of demurrer, to speak of the book in question as
follows:—“In these poems there is enough of originality,
enough of aspiration, enough of conscious energy, enough
of growing power to warrant any expectations, however
sanguine, which the patrons and the friends and parents of
the deceased could have formed.” Meaning nothing, or rather
meaning anything, as we choose to interpret it, this
sentence was still sufficient (and in fact the half of it would
have been more than sufficient) to establish upon an immovable
basis the reputation of Miss Davidson in America.
Thenceforward any examination of her true claims to distinction
was considered little less than a declaration of
heresy. Nor does the awe of the laureate’s <span class='it'>ipse dixit</span> seem
even yet to have entirely subsided. “The genius of Lucretia
Davidson,” says Miss Sedgwick in the very volume now
before us, “has had the meed of far more authoritative
praise than ours; the following tribute is from the London
Quarterly Review.” What this lady—for whom and for
whose opinion we still have the highest respect—can mean
by calling the praise of Southey “more authoritative” than
her own, is a point we shall not pause to determine. <span class='it'>Her</span>
praise is at least honest, or we hope so. Its “authority” is
in exact proportion with each one’s estimate of her judgment.
But it would not do to say all this of the author of
“Thalaba.” It would not do to say it in the hearing of men
who are sane, and who, being sane, have perused the leading
articles in the “London Quarterly Review” during the
ten or fifteen years prior to that period when Robert
Southey, having concocted “The Doctor,” took definitive
leave of his wits. In fact, for any thing that we have yet
seen or heard to the contrary, the opinion of the laureate, in
respect to the poem of “Amir Khan,” is a matter still only
known to Robert Southey. But were it known to all the
world, as Miss Sedgwick supposes with so charmingly innocent
an air;—we mean to say were it really an honest opinion,—this
“authoritative praise,”—still it would be worth,
in the eyes of every sensible person, only just so much as
it demonstrates, or makes a show of demonstrating. Happily
the day has gone by, and we trust forever, when men
are content to swear blindly by the words of a master, poet-laureate
though he be. But what Southey says of the poem
is at best an opinion and no more. What Miss Sedgwick
says of it is very much in the same predicament. “Amir
Khan,” she writes, “has long been before the public, but we
think it has suffered from a general and very natural distrust
of precocious genius. The versification is graceful,
the story beautifully developed, and the orientalism well
sustained. <span class='it'>We think it would not have done discredit to
our most popular poets in the meridian of their fame; as
the production of a girl of fifteen it seems prodigious.</span>”
The cant of a kind heart when betraying into error a naturally
sound judgment, is perhaps the only species of cant
in the world not altogether contemptible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We yield to no one in warmth of admiration for the personal
character of these sweet sisters, as that character is
depicted by the mother, by Miss Sedgwick, and by Mr.
Irving. But it costs us no effort to distinguish that which,
in our heart, is love of their worth, from that which, in our
intellect, is appreciation of their poetic ability. With the
former, as critic, we have nothing to do. The distinction
is one too obvious for comment; and its observation would
have spared us much twaddle on the part of the commentators
upon “Amir Khan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We will endeavor to convey, as concisely as possible,
some idea of this poem as it exists, not in the fancy of the
enthusiastic, but in fact. It includes four hundred and forty
lines. The metre is chiefly octo-syllabic: At one point it
is varied by a casual introduction of an anapæst in the first
and second foot; at another (in a song) by seven stanzas of
four lines each, rhyming alternately; the metre anapæstic of
four feet alternating with three. The versification is always
good, so far as the meagre written rules of our English
prosody extend; that is to say, there is seldom a syllable too
much or too little; but long and short syllables are placed at
random, and a crowd of consonants sometimes renders a
line unpronounceable. For example:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>He loved,—and oh, he loved so well</p>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>That sorrow scarce dared break the spell</span>.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>At times, again, the rhythm lapses, in the most inartistical
manner, and evidently without design, from one species to
another altogether incongruous; as, for example, in the
sixth line of these eight, where the tripping anapæstic
stumbles into the demure iambic, recovering itself, even
more awkwardly, in the conclusion:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Bright Star of the Morning! this bosom is cold—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;I was forced from my native shade,</p>
<p class='line0'>And I wrapped me around with my mantle’s fold,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;A sad, mournful Circassian maid!</p>
<p class='line0'>And I then vow’d that rapture should never move</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>This changeless cheek, this rayless eye</span>,</p>
<p class='line0'>And I then vowed to feel neither bliss nor love,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;<span class='it'>But I vowed I would meet thee and die</span>.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Occasionally the versification rises into melody and even
strength; as here—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>’Twas at the hour when Peris love</p>
<p class='line0'>To gaze upon the Heaven above</p>
<p class='line0'>Whose portals bright with many a gem</p>
<p class='line0'>Are closed—forever closed <span class='it'>on them</span>.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>Upon the whole, however, it is feeble, vacillating, and ineffective;
giving token of having been “touched up” by
the hand of a friend, from a much worse, into its present
condition. Such rhymes as floor and shower—ceased and
breast—shade and spread—brow and wo—clear and far—clear
and air—morning and dawning—forth and earth—step
and deep—Khan and hand—are constantly occurring;
and although, certainly, we should not, <span class='it'>as a general rule</span>,
expect better things from a girl of sixteen, we still look in
vain, and with something very much akin to a smile, for
aught even approaching that “<span class='it'>marvellous ease and grace
of versification</span>” about which Miss Sedgwick, in the benevolence
of her heart, discourses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor does the story, to our dispassionate apprehension,
appear “beautifully developed.” It runs thus:—Amir
Khan, Subahdar of Cachemere, weds a Circassian slave
who, cold as a statue and as obstinately silent, refuses to
return his love. The Subahdar applies to a magician, who
gives him</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;a pensive flower</p>
<p class='line0'>Gathered at midnight’s magic hour;</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>the effect of whose perfume renders him apparently lifeless
while still in possession of all his senses. Amreeta, the
slave, supposing her lover dead, gives way to clamorous
grief, and reveals the secret love which she has long borne
her lord, but refused to divulge because a slave. Amir Khan
hereupon revives, and all trouble is at an end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course, no one at all read in Eastern fable will be
willing to give Miss Davidson credit for <span class='it'>originality</span> in the
conception of this little story; and if she have claim to
merit at all, as regards it, that claim must be founded upon
the manner of narration. But it will be at once evident
that the most naked outline alone can be given in the compass
of four hundred and forty lines. The tale is, in sober
fact, told very much as any young person might be expected
to tell it. The strength of the narrator is wholly laid out upon
a description of moonlight (in the usual style) with which
the poem commences—upon a second description of moonlight
(in precisely the same manner) with which a second
division commences—and in a third description of the hall
in which the entranced Subahdar reposes. This is all—absolutely
all; or at least the rest has the nakedness of mere
catalogue. We recognize, throughout, the poetic sentiment,
but little—very little—of poetic <span class='it'>power</span>. We see occasional
gleams of imagination: for example—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>And every crystal cloud of Heaven</p>
<p class='line0'>Bowed as it passed the queen of even.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Amreeta was cold as the marble floor</p>
<p class='line0'>That glistens beneath the nightly shower.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>At that calm hour when Peris love</p>
<p class='line0'>To gaze upon the Heaven above,</p>

<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>The Subahdar with noiseless step</p>
<p class='line0'>Rushed like the night-breeze o’er the deep.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>We look in vain for another instance worth quoting. But
were the fancy seen in these examples observable either in
the general conduct or in the incidents of the narrative, we
should not feel obliged to disagree so unequivocally with
that opinion which pronounces this clever little production
“<span class='it'>one which would not have done discredit to our most
popular poets in the meridian of their fame</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As the work of a girl of sixteen,” most assuredly we <span class='it'>do
not</span> think it “<span class='it'>prodigious</span>.” In regard to it we may repeat
what we said of “Lenore,”—that we have seen finer poems
in every respect, written by children of more immature age.
It is a creditable composition; nothing beyond this. And,
in so saying, we shall startle none but the brainless, and the
adopters of ready-made ideas. We are convinced that we
express the unuttered sentiment of every educated individual
who has read the poem. Nor, having given the plain facts
of the case, do we feel called upon to proffer any apology
for our flat refusal to play ditto either to Miss Sedgwick, to
Mr. Irving, or to Mr. Southey.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>The Seaman’s Friend; Containing a Treatise on Practical
Seamanship, with Plates; A Dictionary of Sea
Terms; Customs and Usages of the Merchant Service;
Laws Relating to the Practical Duties of Masters and
Mariners. By</span> <span class='sc'>R. H. Dana, Jr.</span> <span class='it'>Author of “Two Years
Before the Mast.” Little and Brown: Boston. Carey
and Hart: Philadelphia.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The publishers of this neat little volume have very prudently
stereotyped it; anticipating an extensive and continuous
demand. In truth, the work belongs to the class of the
obviously needful, and its circulation and appreciation are
matters of certainty. Ever since men “went down to the
sea in ships,” there has been a difficulty in procuring exact,
compact, and universally intelligible information on the very
topics which Mr. Dana now discusses. The necessary
knowledge was to be gleaned, imperfectly and superficially,
from amid a mass of technical jargon, diffused over a world
of questionable authority. Books on Seamanship are extant,
to be sure—works of the highest scientific merit and
ability—and the writings of Captain Basil Hall give, incidentally,
a vast fund of intelligence on naval subjects; but
the true <span class='it'>desideratum</span> was a work which could only be written
by an individual placed exactly in the circumstances
which surrounded Mr. Dana. It is well known that he is a
man of talent and well educated; that ill-health induced
him to try a sea-voyage in the capacity of common sailor;
and that thus he has been enabled to combine the advantages
of theoretical and practical science. His “Two Years Before
the Mast” was, very deservedly, one of the most popular
books ever published, and proved immensely profitable—at
least to his booksellers. It gave, in a rich strain of philosophical
observation, all the racy <span class='it'>spirit</span>, as the present volume
conveys all the exact <span class='it'>letter</span> of the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is only one improvement which we could wish to
suggest. An appendix, we think, should be added; embracing,
first, in as popular, that is to say, in as untechnical
a form as possible, the philosophy of latitude and longitude—the
general principles of which may be rendered
intelligible to almost any understanding—and, secondly, the
formulæ employed in the application of these principles to
navigation, with concise rules for the use of the sextant and
chronometer, and for solar, lunar, and stellar observations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This story originally appeared in the “Dublin University

<p class='pindent'>This is a book about which little can be said, except in the
way of general and pointed commendation. Its title fully
explains its character; although the fair authoress is at the
trouble of enlarging upon the nature of the fragmentary
contents. These <span class='it'>scraps</span> embody specimens of every variety
of the prose literature of Germany—convey, <span class='it'>in petto</span>, its

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In general, Mr. Simms should be considered as one giving
<span class='it'>indication</span>, rather than <span class='it'>proof</span> of high genius. He puts us
in mind of a volcano, from the very darkness issuing from
whose crater we judge of the fire that is weltering below.
So far, with slight exceptions, he has buried his fine talent
in his themes. He should never have written “The Partisan,”
nor “The Yemassee,” nor his late book (whose title
we just now forget) about the first discovery of the Pacific.
His genius does not lie in the outward so much as in the
inner world. “Martin Faber” did him honor; and so do
the present volumes, although liable to objection in some
important respects. We welcome him home to his own
proper field of exertion—the field of Godwin and Brown—the
field of his own rich intellect and glowing <span class='it'>heart</span>. Upon
reading the first few pages of “Confession,” the stirring
words of Scott arose to our lips—“My foot is on my native
heath, and my name is McGregor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is our design to speak in full of the volumes before us;
but we have left ourselves no space for the task, and must
defer it, perforce, until the new year.</p>

imitation of the Pelhams and Vivian Greys. It abounds,
even more than either of these works, in point, pungency
and vivacity, but falls below them in true wit, and in other
higher qualities. Altogether, it is richly entertaining, and
will meet with success. The theme is a good one well

<div><h1><a id='sec'></a>SECRET WRITING.</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The annexed letter from a gentleman whose abilities we
very highly respect, was received, unfortunately, at too late
a period to appear in our November number:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:1em;'><span class='sc'>Dear sir</span>:</p>

<p class='pindent'>I should perhaps apologise for again intruding a subject
upon which you have so ably commented, and which may
be supposed by this time to have been almost exhausted;
but as I have been greatly interested in the articles upon
“cryptography,” which have appeared in your Magazine, I
think that you will excuse the present intrusion of a few
remarks. With secret writing I have been practically conversant
for several years, and I have found, both in correspondence
and in the preservation of private memoranda,
the frequent benefit of its peculiar virtues. I have thus a
record of thoughts, feelings and occurrences,—a history of
my <span class='it'>mental</span> existence, to which I may turn, and in imagination,
retrace former pleasures, and again live through by-gone
scenes,—secure in the conviction that the magic scroll
has a tale for <span class='it'>my</span> eye alone. Who has not longed for such
a confidante?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cryptography is, indeed, not only a topic of mere curiosity,
but is of general interest, as furnishing an excellent exercise
for mental discipline, and of high <span class='it'>practical</span> importance
on various occasions;—to the statesman and the general—to
the scholar and the traveller,—and, may I not add
“last though not least,” to the <span class='it'>lover</span>? What can be so
delightful amid the trials of absent lovers, as a secret intercourse
between them of their hopes and fears,—safe from
the prying eyes of some old aunt, or it may be, of a perverse
and <span class='it'>cruel</span> guardian?—a <span class='it'>billet doux</span> that will not betray its
mission, even if intercepted, and that can “tell no tales” if
lost, or, (which <span class='it'>sometimes</span> occurs,) if <span class='it'>stolen</span> from its violated
depository.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the solution of the various ciphers which have been
submitted to your examination, you have exhibited a power
of analytical and synthetical reasoning I have never seen
equalled; and the astonishing skill you have displayed,—particularly
in deciphering the cryptograph of Dr. Charles
J. Frailey, will, I think, crown you the king of “secret-readers.”
But notwithstanding this, I think your opinion that
the construction of a <span class='it'>real cryptograph</span> is impossible, not sufficiently
supported. Those examples which you have published
have indeed not been of that character, as you have
fully proved. They have, moreover, not been sufficiently
accurate, for where the key was a phrase, (and consequently
the same character was employed for several letters,) different
words would be formed with the same ciphers. The
sense could then only be ascertained from the context, and
this would amount to a probability—generally of a high
degree, I admit—but still not to a positive certainly. Nay,
a case might readily be imagined, where the most important
word of the communication, and one on which the sense of
the whole depended, should have so equivocal a nature, that
the person for whose benefit it was intended, would be unable,
even with the aid of his key, to discover which of two
very different interpretations should be the correct one. If
necessary, this can easily be shown; thus, for example, suppose
a lady should receive from her affianced, a letter written
in ciphers, containing this sentence, “4 5663 967 268 26
3633,” and that <span class='it'>a</span> and <span class='it'>n</span> were represented by the figure 2,—<span class='it'>e</span>,
<span class='it'>m</span>, and <span class='it'>r</span> by 3,—<span class='it'>i</span> by 4,—<span class='it'>l</span> by 5,—<span class='it'>o</span>, <span class='it'>s</span>, and <span class='it'>v</span> by 6,—<span class='it'>u</span>
by 7,—<span class='it'>w</span> by 8,—and <span class='it'>y</span> by 9; a moment’s inspection will
show that the sentence might either be “I love you now as
ever,” or “I love you now <span class='it'>no more</span>.” How “positively
shocking,” “to say the least of it;” and yet several of the
ciphers that you have published, have required a greater
number of letters to be represented by one character, than
any to be found in the example before us. It is evident,
then, that this is not a very desirable system, as it would
scarcely be more useful than a lock without its key, or with
one that did not fit its wards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I think, however, that there are various methods by which
a hieroglyphic might be formed, whose meaning would be
perfectly “hidden;” and I shall give one or two examples
of what I consider such. A method which I have adopted
for my own private use, is one which I am satisfied is of this
nature, as it cannot possibly be solved without the assistance
of its key, and that key, by which <span class='it'>alone</span> it can be unlocked,
exists only in my mind; at the same time it is so simple,
that with the practice in it which I have had, I now read it,
and write it, with as much facility as I can the English character.
As I prefer not giving it here, I shall be compelled to
have recourse to some other plan that is more complicated.
By a <span style='font-size:smaller'>CRYPTOGRAPH</span>, I understand—a communication which,
though <span class='it'>clearly</span> ascertained by means of its proper key, cannot
possibly be without it. To most persons, who have not
thought much upon the subject, an article written in simple
cipher, (by which I mean with each letter uniformly represented
by a single distinct character,) would appear to be an
impenetrable mystery; and they would doubtless imagine
that the more complicated the method of constructing such
a cipher, the more <span class='it'>insoluble</span>—to use a chemical expression—would
be the puzzle, since so much less would be the
chance of discovering its key. This very natural conclusion
is, however, erroneous, as it is founded on the supposition
that possession must first be obtained of the key, in order to
unravel the difficulty,—which is not the case. The process
of reasoning employed in resolving “secret writing” has
not the slightest relation to the form or description of the
characters used, but refers simply to their succession, and
to a comparison of words in which the same letters occur.
By these means any cipher of this nature can be unriddled,
as experience has fully shown. A very successful method
of avoiding detection, would be to apply the simple cipher
to words written backwards and continuously. This, I conceive,
might be called a perfect cryptograph, since from the
want of spaces, and consequently the impossibility of comparing
words, it would utterly perplex the person attempting
to discover its hidden import, and yet with the help of
the key, each letter being known, the words could easily be
separated and inverted. I give a short specimen of this
style, and would feel much gratified with your opinion of the
possibility of reading it.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i138.jpg' alt='a cryptograph' id='iid-0073' style='width:100%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Should this not be considered <span class='it'>perfect</span>, (though I suspect it
would puzzle even the ingenious editor to detect its meaning,)
I shall give another method below, which I can show
<span class='it'>must</span> be, and if I am successful I think you will do me the
justice to admit that “human ingenuity” has contrived “a
cipher which human ingenuity cannot resolve.” I wish to
be distinctly understood; the secret communication above,
and the one following, are not intended to show that you
have promised more than you can perform. I do not take
up the gauntlet. Your challenge, I am happy to testify,
has been more than amply redeemed. It is merely with an
incidental remark of yours, that I am at present engaged,
and my object is to show that however correct it may be
generally,—it is not so universally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Agreeably to a part of my foregoing definition, <span class='it'>that</span> cannot
be a proper cryptograph, in which a single character is made
to represent more than one letter. Let us for a moment see
what would be the result if this was reversed,—that is, if
more than one cipher were used for a single letter. In case
each letter were represented by two different characters,
(used alternately or at random,) it is evident that while the
certainty of reading such a composition correctly, by help
of the key, would not be at all diminished, the difficulty of
its solution without that help, would be vastly increased.
This then is an approach to the formation of a secret cipher.
If, now, the number of the characters were extended to three
or four for each letter, it might be pronounced with tolerable
certainty that such a writing would be “secret.” Or, to
take an extreme case, a communication might be made, in
which no two characters would be alike! Here all reasoning
would be entirely baffled, as there would evidently be no
objects of <span class='it'>comparison</span>; and even if half a dozen words were
known, they would furnish no clue to the rest. Here, then,
is a complete <span class='it'>non plus</span> to investigation, and we have arrived
at a perfect cryptograph. For, since any given cipher
would stand for but one letter in the key, there could be but
a single and definite solution; and thus both conditions of
my definition are fully satisfied. In the following specimen
of this method, I have employed the Roman-capital, small
letter, and small capital, with their several inversions, giving
me the command of 130 characters, or an average of
five to each letter. This is to “make assurance doubly sure,”
for I am satisfied that were an average of three characters
used for each letter, such a writing would be emphatically
secret. If you will be so kind as to give my cipher a place
in your interesting Magazine, I will immediately forward you
its key. Hoping that you will not be displeased with my
tedious letter,</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:3em;'>I am most respectfully yours.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i139.jpg' alt='a cryptograph' id='iid-0074' style='width:100%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The difficulty attending the cipher by key-phrase, viz:
that the same characters may convey various meanings—is
a difficulty upon which we commented in our first article
upon this topic, and more lately at greater length in a private
letter to our friend F. W. Thomas. The key-phrase cryptograph
is, in fact, altogether inadmissible. The labor requisite
for its elucidation, <span class='it'>even with the key</span>, would, alone,
render it so. Lord Bacon very properly defines three <span class='it'>essentials</span>
in secret correspondence. It is required, first, that the
cipher be such as to elude suspicion of being a cipher;
secondly, that its alphabet be so simple of formation as to
demand but little time in the construction of an epistle;
thirdly, that it shall be absolutely insoluble without the key—we
may add, fourthly, that, with the key, it be promptly
and <span class='it'>certainly</span> decipherable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Admitting, now, that the ingenious cryptograph proposed
by our correspondent be absolutely what he supposes it, impenetrable,
it would still, we think, be inadmissible on the
first point above stated, and more so on the second. But of
its impenetrability we are by no means sure, notwithstanding
what, at a cursory glance, appears to be the <span class='it'>demonstration</span>
of the writer. In the key-phrase cipher an arbitrary
character is sometimes made to represent five, six, seven,
or even more letters. Our correspondent proposes merely
to reverse the operation:—and this simple statement of the
case will do more towards convincing him of his error than
an elaborate argument, for which we would neither have
time, nor our readers patience. In a key-phrase cryptograph,
equally as in his own, each discovery is <span class='it'>independent</span>, not
<span class='it'>necessarily</span> affording any clue to farther discovery. Neither
is the idea of our friend, although highly ingenious, philosophical,
and unquestionably original with him, (since he so
assures us,) original <span class='it'>in itself</span>. It is one of the many systems
tried by Dr. Wallis and found wanting. Perhaps no
good cipher was <span class='it'>ever</span> invented which its originator did not
conceive insoluble; yet, so far, no impenetrable cryptograph
has been discovered. Our correspondent will be the less
startled at this, our assertion, when he bears in mind that he
who has been termed the “wisest of mankind”—we mean
Lord Verulam—was as confident of the absolute insolubility
of his own mode as our present cryptographist is of his.
What he said upon the subject in his <span class='it'>De Augmentis</span> was, at
the day of its publication, considered unanswerable. Yet his
cipher has been repeatedly unriddled. We may say, in addition,
that the nearest approach to perfection in this matter,
is the <span class='it'>chiffre quarré</span> of the French Academy. This consists
of a table somewhat in the form of our ordinary multiplication
tables, from which the secret to be conveyed is so
written that no letter is ever represented twice by the same
character. Out of a thousand individuals nine hundred and
ninety-nine would at once pronounce this mode inscrutable.
It is yet susceptible, under peculiar circumstances, of prompt
and certain solution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. T. will have still less confidence in his hastily adopted
opinions on this topic when we assure him, from personal
experience, that what he says in regard to writing backwards
and continuously without intervals between the words—is
all wrong. So far from “utterly perplexing the decipherer,”
it gives him no difficulty, legitimately so called—merely
taxing to some extent his patience. We refer
him to the files of “Alexander’s Weekly Messenger” for
1839—where he will see that we read numerous ciphers of
the class described, even when very ingenious <span class='it'>additional</span>
difficulties were interposed. We say, in brief, that we should
have little trouble in reading the one now proposed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here,” says our friend, referring to another point, “all
reasoning would be entirely baffled, as there would evidently
be no objects of <span class='it'>comparison</span>.” This sentence assures
us that he is laboring under much error in his conception of
cipher-solutions. <span class='it'>Comparison</span> is a vast <span class='it'>aid</span> unquestionably;
but not an absolute <span class='it'>essential</span> in the elucidation of these
mysteries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We need not say, however, that this subject is an excessively
wide one. Our friend will forgive us for not
entering into details which would lead us—God knows
whither. The ratiocination actually passing through the
mind in the solution of even a simple cryptograph, if detailed
step by step, would fill a large volume. Our time is
much occupied; and notwithstanding the limits originally
placed to our cartel, we have found ourselves overwhelmed
with communications on this subject; and must close it,
perforce—deeply interesting as we find it. To this resolution
we had arrived last month; but the calm and truly ingenious
reasoning of our correspondent has induced us to
say these few words more. We print his cipher—with no
promise to attempt its solution ourselves—much as we feel
inclined to make the promise—and to keep it. Some of
our hundred thousand readers will, no doubt, take up the
gauntlet thrown down; and our pages shall be open for any
communication on the subject, which shall not tax our own
abilities or time.</p>

<hr class='tbk128'/>

<p class='pindent'>In speaking of our hundred thousand readers (and we can
scarcely suppose the number to be less), we are reminded
that of this vast number, one and only one has succeeded in
solving the cryptograph of Dr. Frailey. The honor of the
solution, is however, due to Mr. <span class='sc'>Richard Bolton</span>, of Pontotoc,
Mississippi. His letter did not reach us until three
weeks after the completion of our November number, in
which we should, otherwise, have acknowledged it.</p>

<hr class='tbk129'/>

<div><h1><a id='close'></a>THE CLOSING YEAR.</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Perhaps</span> the editors of no magazine, either in America or
Europe, ever sat down, at the close of a year, to contemplate
the progress of their work with more satisfaction than we
do now. Our success has been unexampled, almost incredible.
We may assert without fear of contradiction that
no periodical ever witnessed the same increase during so
short a period. We began the year almost unknown; certainly
far behind our cotemporaries in numbers; we close
it with a list of twenty-five thousand subscribers, and the
assurance on every hand that our popularity has as yet
seen only its dawning. But if such is the orient, what will
our noonday be? Nor, if we may for once play the egotist,
is this success wholly undeserved. Everything that talent,
taste, capital, or energy could do for “Graham’s Magazine”
has been done, and that too without stint. The best typography,
the choicest engravers, the finest writers, the most
finished artists, and the utmost punctuality in our business
department, have lent their aid to forward our enterprise;
and what neither could have done singly, all combined have
effected. Nothing has been spared. The splendor of our
embellishments has never been equalled: the variety and
richness of our literary matter are not to be surpassed. We
not only present a choicer list of contributors than any other
magazine in the country, but we rejoice in more than one
writer whom we alone have been able to tempt from their
retreats, and who cannot be induced to contribute to any
cotemporary. We have secured the exclusive services of
<span class='sc'>Sartain</span>, and have made a permanent engagement with
<span class='sc'>Sadd</span>. Our Fashion Plates have become the standards in that
department, and the line engravings we have furnished have
been universally cited as superior to those of the richest
Annuals. In literary rank we are assigned the first place of
our class, and our criticisms on books are deferred to as the
best in the country. We may speak thus boldly, because,
although we may be only Snug the Joiner, yet whenever we
roar as now, it is in the character of the lion. Reviewing,
therefore, our past success, and taking it—and why not?—as
an earnest for the future, we can afford, we opine, to sip
our cup of choice Mocha at ease, and if not to “shoulder
our crutch,” at least to “tell how fields were won.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We shall begin the new year determined to surpass even
what we have done. As we have introduced a new era into
magazine history we shall not pause until the revolution is
complete. We shall not follow the namby-pamby style of
periodical literature, but aim at a loftier and more extended
flight. For this purpose we shall increase the amount of
our reading matter, although, at the same time, our embellishments
shall even be superior in beauty to what they are
at present. We have made arrangements by which the
graceful pens of two lady-editors will be added to our
strength. Our editorial list will then be as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

</div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Our Prospectus will show the number of American writers,
in addition to the editors, enlisted in the work. With
such a <span class='it'>corps</span> we may make any promises.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To ensure a supply of the best original engravings we have,
in addition to Messrs. Sartain and Sadd, procured the aid of
Messrs. Rawdon, Wright, Hatch and Smillie, and Mr. Dick,—all
well known for the elegance of their work. Our chief
illustrations shall, however, be as heretofore, mezzotinto
engravings,—they being decidedly the most effective, elegant,
rare, and desirable. This field we shall enjoy without
even an attempt at serious competition, it being impossible
for any other like magazine to bring out the same or equal
talent in this way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now, as the play is over and we have spoken the epilogue,
we will draw the curtain with a single wish: “a happy
new year, and many of them, to our subscribers.”</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
